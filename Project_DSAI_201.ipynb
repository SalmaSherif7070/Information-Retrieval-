This is a serious question. If ever there was a time to stand up for the rights of an oppressed people, this is it. And yet, in many places in the western world, you can’t. It’s literally been outlawed. How is this even possible?As I’m writing this, Francesca Albanese, the UN special rapporteur on the occupied territories, is pleading with the UN secretary general, António Guterres, to demand Israel stop its killing. “The delay in calling on Israel to cease taking revenge on millions of Palestinian civilians,” she wrote on X (formerly Twitter), “is intensifying the descent into [the] abyss.”Hamas’s barbarism does not justify the collective punishment of Palestinians | Kenan MalikRead moreHundreds of thousands of Palestinians have been forcibly displaced by the Israeli military after the entire population of northern Gaza, some 1.1 million people, has been ordered to leave everything behind and move south. (Gaza’s population is mostly refugees from 1948, and some have refused to flee, having once lost their original homes 75 years ago.) Israeli bombs have killed more than 2,670 people, at least 724 of whom were children. And every single member of 47 different Palestinian families – some 500 people, including dozens of children and babies – has been killed by Israeli airstrikes.The term genocide, like fascism, is often flung around carelessly these days, but it’s worth recalling that there is an official definition. The crime of genocide is “to destroy, in whole, or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group”. No minimum number of victims is necessary to establish genocide, but the loss must be severe enough that it “will impact the group as a whole”. Since close to 50 families have already and horrifically been exterminated, and we’re only just past the first week of this carnage, what other word should we choose?The urgency to demonstrate against such horrors could not be more necessary. Yet our contemporary ambassadors of the enlightenment have other ideas. Across the western world, our political leadership has decided that freedom of opinion must be curtailed, that expressions of support for Palestinians reflexively equate to support for Hamas and terrorism, and that Palestinian narratives simply must be suppressed. These notions aren’t just hollow. They’re dangerous.The French minister of the interior, Gérald Darmanin, sent a message to French police banning pro-Palestinians protests. He wrote that “pro-Palestinian demonstrations must be prohibited because they are likely to generate disturbances to the public order”. Adopting this logic, I suppose we should amend the Universal Declaration of the Rights of Man to the Universal Declaration of the Rights of Man Unless Such Rights are Likely to Generate Disturbances to the Public Order. Needless to say, government prohibitions on freedom of speech amount to censorship.Death is commonplace for Gaza’s lost generationRead moreBerlin also banned pro-Palestinian protests. Vienna banned pro-Palestinians protests. Several cities in Australia banned pro-Palestinian protests. In the UK, the home secretary, Suella Braverman, told senior police officers that waving a Palestinian flag or chanting specific phrases for Palestine may be a criminal offense.It’s one thing when those in power attempt to suppress your story by privileging another. It’s quite another when they criminalize your story by false attribution and making everyone afraid of you.That tens of thousands did march for Gaza in London, and protesters gathered across the United Kingdom, the United States and other parts of the western world, sometimes risking arrest, merely to express support for the Palestinians illustrates precisely the kind of courage that is needed right now. At Brooklyn College, where I teach, the college president forced students protesting for Palestinian rights off campus, where they were met with a phalanx of police officers and a pro-Israel city councilwoman who came brandishing her own weapon.In such an environment, supporting Palestinians in Gaza today – as they face depopulation, deportation and death – means literally putting your own life on the line. In fact, just being Palestinian can mean risking your life. We already have a fatality in the United States. In Plainfield, Illinois, six-year-old Wadea Al-Fayoume was stabbed 26 times to death and his mother was also grievously harmed in a hate crime allegedly motivated because mother and child were Muslim at a time when the official discourse is telling the population that Muslims and Palestinians are to be hated.Netanyahu told 1.1 million Palestinians they had 24 hours to evacuate. What is that if not ethnic cleansing? | Sarah HelmRead moreHow can we stop such horror? There is pain everywhere right now. I too feel it. In the last few days, a celebrated Gazan poet I know has lost 30 members of his family to Israeli bombs. A gifted Palestinian American doctor, poet and translator I know has spoken powerfully about his grief after Israeli airstrikes killed 17 members of his family in Gaza. A highly respected colleague of mine in California has told us that his niece and her husband, residents of Kibbutz Nir Oz, have been abducted by Hamas, also clearly a war crime and an atrocity. Each one of these experiences matter. Our suffering is human, and grief has no nationality.But what about justice? How many times have we been lectured about so-called western values? I am a person born and raised in the west. I am a westerner, and yet those so-called values are sounding very much like Gazans, Palestinians, Arabs and Muslims are utterly disposable. We hear Israel present the situation as if it has no choice but genocide, and we are expected to go along with this? Never. One can be opposed to Hamas, as I am, and to genocide, as I am. That’s not hard to comprehend. The fact that this has been made difficult or in some cases criminal to say, reveals just how superficial those so-called western values actually have been, and how standing up for Palestine today is also to save the west from the very worst of itself.

Half the population is struggling with catastrophic hunger and famine is imminent in northern parts of Gaza, according to the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), the global body responsible for declaring famine.Save the Children says families are struggling to find enough food and water and children are dying because of malnutrition and disease.Even before the current conflict, about 80% of the population of Gaza was in need of humanitarian aid. Aid deliveries halted at the start of the latest conflict have resumed, but at much lower levels - with about 164 aid lorries a day crossing into southern Gaza from Egypt.The World Food Programme says that addressing the simple food needs would require at least 300 trucks a day to enter Gaza and distribute food.Agencies say distribution is hampered by the lack of infrastructure as the area endures intense bombardment, movement restrictions, interrupted communications and fuel shortages.There have also been reports of crowds looting aid lorries.The WFP\\'s chief operating officer, Carl Skau said: \"The complicated border controls, combined with the high tensions and desperation inside Gaza, make it nearly impossible for food supplies to reach people in need, particularly in the north.\"Some countries, including the US, Belgium and Jordan, have delivered aid by air - parachuting crates of aid from planes into coastal areas.Aid charity World Central Kitchen built its own jetty on the coast and delivered 200 tonnes of food by sea in its first shipment. The cargo includes beans, carrots, canned tuna, chickpeas, canned corn, parboiled rice, flour, oil, salt and pallets of dates.Image source, ReutersThe US military is also planning to build a temporary dock and pier for deliveries by sea.Israel\\'s ground offensiveThe desperate food situation comes after six months of conflict.Israel responded to the 7 October attacks by Hamas with an intense bombing campaign, followed by a ground invasion. Armoured bulldozers created routes for tanks and troops, as the Israeli forces tried to clear the area of Hamas fighters based in northern Gaza.Having cut Gaza in two, the Israelis pushed further into Gaza City, where they faced resistance from Hamas. While Israeli forces have since conducted ground operations across much of northern Gaza, there are still clashes in some areas, according to analysts from the Institute for the Study of War.Whole districts in Gaza City have been razed to the ground and swathes of agricultural land and greenhouse areas have been returned to sand under the tracks of heavy vehicles and tanks as part of clearing operations by Israeli troops.Image source, Getty ImagesCivilians living in the area north of the Wadi Gaza riverbed, including the densely populated Gaza City, were warned to evacuate in October. The Erez border crossing into Israel in the north was closed, so those living in the evacuation zone had no choice but to head towards the southern districts.Millions seek shelter in southern GazaAfter establishing a strong position in the north, Israeli forces focused their attention on the southern cities. The main urban areas - Khan Younis and Rafah - have been bombed and Israeli troops have clashed with Hamas fighters on the ground. The local population, now including thousands who fled fighting in the north, have been told to move to a so-called \"safe area\" at al-Mawasi, a thin strip of mainly agricultural land along the Mediterranean coast, close to the Egyptian border.Image source, ReutersFighting in Khan Younis and the central Deir al Balah area has also pushed tens of thousands of people to flee to the southern district of Rafah, the UN said, where more than a million people \"are squeezed into an extremely overcrowded space\".According to the UN, just over 75% of Gaza\\'s population - some 1.7 million people - were already registered refugees before October 2023.Palestinian refugees are defined by the UN as people whose \"place of residence was Palestine during the period 1 June 1946 to 15 May 1948, and who lost both home and means of livelihood as a result of the 1948 War\". More than 500,000 of the refugee population lived in eight crowded \"camps\" which became densely packed built-up areas, located across the Strip.Following Israel\\'s warnings after 7 October, many of those refugees joined the hundreds of thousands of people forced to flee their homes, the UN says.On average, before the conflict, there were more than 5,700 people per sq km in Gaza - very similar to the average density in London. The UN says more than half of Gaza\\'s population is now crammed into Rafah - previously a town of 250,000 people.\"Their living conditions are abysmal - they lack the basic necessities to survive, stalked by hunger, disease and death,\" according to the UN\\'s relief co-ordinator Martin Griffiths. Overcrowding has become a major concern in UN emergency shelters in central and southern Gaza, with some far exceeding their capacity. Other families are living in tents or makeshift shelters in compounds or on open areas of waste ground.Areas of new tents that sprung up close to the Egyptian border between the start of December and middle of January cover roughly 3.5 sq km, equivalent to nearly 500 Premier League football pitches.The satellite images, captured on 15 October and 14 January, show a dramatic change - now nearly every patch of accessible, undeveloped ground in an area of north-west Rafah has been turned into a refuge for displaced people. Your device may not support this visualisation Israel has already launched hundreds of airstrikes across Gaza. US intelligence assessments seen by CNN in December said Israel had used more than 29,000 bombs and missiles since the start of the conflict, causing extensive damage to buildings and infrastructure.The World Health Organization (WHO) says up to 80% of civilian infrastructure - including homes, hospitals, schools, water, and sanitation facilities - have been destroyed or severely damaged and will take billions of dollars of investment over decades to recover.The UN\\'s environmental programme says it could take between three and 12 years just to clear the debris and explosive remnants of war.Gazan officials warn more than 500,000 people will have no homes to return to, and many more will not be able to return immediately after the conflict because of damage to surrounding infrastructure.The map below - using analysis of satellite data by Corey Scher of CUNY Graduate Center and Jamon Van Den Hoek of Oregon State University - shows which urban areas have sustained concentrated damage since the start of the conflict.They say at least 160,000 buildings across the whole Gaza Strip have suffered damage. North Gaza and Gaza City have borne the brunt of this, with at least 70% of buildings in the two northern regions believed to have been damaged, but their analysis now suggests up to 54% of buildings in the Khan Younis area have also been damaged.Many healthcare facilities have been left unable to function as a result of bomb damage or lack of supplies and fuel.The UN says hospital capacity is overstretched and only 12 of Gaza\\'s 36 hospitals are still partially functioning. Some hospitals have also become the target of Israeli operations as they say Hamas use the buildings. Medics working at Khan Younis\\'s Nasser hospital were shot at and detained during an Israeli raid in February. Israeli forces say they killed a number of Hamas \"terrorists\" and detained dozens of suspects in an operation at Gaza City\\'s al-Shifa hospital this week. Trapped by gunfire at Gaza hospital, people risked death to help injuredGaza medics tell BBC that Israeli troops beat and humiliated themMore than 1,200 Israelis and foreign nationals were killed during the Hamas attacks on 7 October. More than 31,000 Palestinians - including about 13,000 children - have been killed in Israeli airstrikes and operations since then, according to Gaza\\'s Hamas-run health ministry. It is difficult for the BBC to verify exact numbers, but the UN\\'s World Health Organization (WHO) WHO has said it has no reason to believe the figures are inaccurate.The images below indicate just how much Gaza has changed. One image, released by the IDF, shows tanks and armoured bulldozers on the beach near Gaza City. A photo of the same beach from last summer shows people making the most of a hot day in Gaza, families splashing in the sea or sitting on fanning out along the beach.

(file) Facebook Twitter Print Email Mass graves in Gaza show victims’ hands were tied, says UN rights office 23 April 2024 Peace and SecurityDisturbing reports continue to emerge about mass graves in Gaza in which Palestinian victims were reportedly found stripped naked with their hands tied, prompting renewed concerns about possible war crimes amid ongoing Israeli airstrikes, the UN human rights office, OHCHR, said on Tuesday. The development follows the recovery of hundreds of bodies “buried deep in the ground and covered with waste” over the weekend at Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis, central Gaza, and at Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City in the north. A total of 283 bodies were recovered at Nasser Hospital, of which 42 were identified. “Among the deceased were allegedly older people, women and wounded, while others were found tied with their hands…tied and stripped of their clothes,” said Ravina Shamdasani, spokesperson for the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights. Al-Shifa discoveryCiting the local health authorities in Gaza, Ms. Shamdasani added that more bodies had been found at Al-Shifa Hospital.The large health complex was the enclave’s main tertiary facility before war erupted on 7 October. It was the focus of an Israeli military incursion to root out Hamas militants allegedly operating inside which ended at the beginning of this month. After two weeks of intense clashes, UN humanitarians assessed the site and confirmed on 5 April that Al-Shifa was “an empty shell”, with most equipment reduced to ashes.“Reports suggest that there were 30 Palestinian bodies buried in two graves in the courtyard of Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City; one in front of the emergency building and the others in front of the dialysis building,” Ms. Shamdasani told journalists in Geneva.The bodies of 12 Palestinians have now been identified from these locations at Al-Shifa, the OHCHR spokesperson continued, but identification has not yet been possible for the remaining individuals. “There are reports that the hands of some of these bodies were also tied,” Ms. Shamdasani said, adding that there could be “many more” victims, “despite the claim by the Israeli Defense Forces to have killed 200 Palestinians during the Al-Shifa medical complex operation”.200 days of horrorSome 200 days since intense Israeli bombardment began in response to Hamas-led terror attacks in southern Israel, UN human rights chief Volker Türk expressed his horror at the destruction of Nasser and Al-Shifa hospitals and the reported discovery of mass graves. Tweet URL UNHumanRights “The intentional killing of civilians, detainees and others who are hors de combat is a war crime,” Mr. Türk said in a call for independent investigations into the deaths.Mounting tollAs of 22 April, more than 34,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza, including 14,685 children and 9,670 women, the High Commissioner’s office said, citing the enclave’s health authorities. Another 77,084 have been injured, and over 7,000 others are assumed to be under the rubble. “Every 10 minutes a child is killed or wounded. They are protected under the laws of war, and yet they are ones who are disproportionately paying the ultimate price in this war,” said the High Commissioner. Türk warningThe UN rights chief also reiterated his warning against a full-scale Israeli incursion of Rafah, where an estimated 1.2 million Gazans “have been forcibly cornered”.“The world’s leaders stand united on the imperative of protecting the civilian population trapped in Rafah,” the High Commissioner said in a statement, which also condemned Israeli strikes against Rafah in recent days that mainly killed women and children.This included an attack on an apartment building in the Tal Al Sultan area on 19 April which killed nine Palestinians “including six children and two women”, along with a strike on As Shabora Camp in Rafah a day later that reportedly left four dead, including a girl and a pregnant woman.“The latest images of a premature child taken from the womb of her dying mother, of the adjacent two houses where 15 children and five women were killed, this is beyond warfare,” said Mr. Türk.The High Commissioner decried the “unspeakable suffering” caused by months of warfare and appealed once again for “the resulting misery and destruction, starvation and disease and the risk of wider conflict” to end. Mr. Türk also reiterated his call for an immediate ceasefire, the release of all remaining hostages taken from Israel and those held in arbitrary detention and the unfettered flow of humanitarian aid. © WHO A young girl is transferred from the Kamal Adwan hospital, in the far north of Gaza to a hospital in the south of the enclave. (file) Massive settler attacks in West BankTurning to the West Bank, the UN rights chief said that grave human rights violations had continued there “unabated”. This was despite international condemnation of “massive settler attacks” between 12 and 14 April “that had been facilitated by the Israeli Security Forces (ISF)”.Settler violence has been organized “with the support, protection, and participation of the ISF”, Mr. Türk insisted, before describing a 50-hour long operation into Nur Shams refugee camp and Tulkarem city starting on 18 April.“The ISF deployed ground troops, bulldozers and drones and sealed the camp. Fourteen Palestinians were killed, three of them children,” the UN rights chief said, noting that 10 ISF members had been injured.In a statement, Mr. Türk also highlighted reports that several Palestinians had been unlawfully killed in the Nur Shams operation “and that the ISF used unarmed Palestinians to shield their forces from attack and killed others in apparent extrajudicial executions”. Dozens were reportedly detained and ill-treated while the ISF “inflicted unprecedented and apparently wanton destruction on the camp and its infrastructure”, the High Commissioner said.

Scores of people were killed while more than 200 others were taken hostage, according to Israeli authorities. The Israeli military subsequently launched retaliatory airstrikes followed by a ground invasion of Gaza, a 140-square-mile territory where more than 2 million Palestinians have lived under a blockade imposed by Israel and supported by Egypt since Hamas came to power in 2007.

Husam is one of more than 600,000 children who have sought refuge in the city, the designated “safe zone” in southern Gaza. But since March, the Israeli government has threatened to extend a military invasion there, too, casting a shadow of fear that has been building for months. “A person’s psyche wears out with fear. It’s a slow death” Husam says as he reflects on what lies ahead.Keep reading list of 3 itemslist 1 of 3I have to show the world what Israel’s doing in Gaza | Close Uplist 2 of 3My day as a doctor at Gaza’s al-Shifa Hospital | Close Uplist 3 of 3This is what 24 hours of our lives in Gaza look like | Close Upend of list Known as “’Gaza’s Isaac Newton” for his ingenuity, Husam has conjured up a makeshift electrical system using two fans that he picked up at a scrap market.

As global leaders implore Israel to refrain from invading Rafah, citing the humanitarian crisis facing millions of civilians trapped there, it’s children like Husam and Najwa who dare to dream of a future free of conflict. In Husam’s own words: “We want to live in freedom and safety like other children around the world.” Watch No Refuge for Rafah’s Children for a poignant portrayal of the challenges Gaza’s children face as Israel’s ground offensive in Rafah looms.

The teacher doesn’t lead all students through the same lessons. Instead, the teacher guides each student on an individualized journey. The what, when, where and how of learning is tailored to meet each student’s strengths, skills, needs, and interests.Students may learn some skills at different paces. But their learning plans still keep them on track to meet the standards for a high school diploma.That kind of classroom isn’t the reality for most students. But it’s the end goal of personalized learning, which is already being used successfully in some schools and is expanding in several states. Here’s what you need to know.What personalized learning isKids learn in different ways and at different paces. Personalized learning is a teaching model based on that premise. Each student gets a “learning plan” based on how they learn, what they know, and what their skills and interests are. It’s the opposite of the “one size fits all” approach used in most schools.Students work with their teachers to set both short-term and long-term goals. This process helps students take ownership of their learning.Teachers make sure learning plans or project-based learning match up with academic standards. And they check to see if students are demonstrating the skills they’re expected to learn as they progress through their education.Personalized learning is not a replacement for special education. It’s an approach to general education that can work with an Individualized Education Program (IEP), a 504 plan, response to intervention, or other specialized intervention programs.But accommodations, supports, and accessible learning strategies need to be essential parts of personalized learning. If done well, all students will be more engaged in their learning. And struggling students will get help sooner. If not done well, students with disabilities could fall further behind.How personalized learning worksNo two schools using personalized learning will look exactly the same. But here are four widely used models that schools follow. Each of these models sets high expectations for all students and aligns their learning to a set of rigorous standards.1. Schools that use learner profiles. This type of school keeps an up-to-date record that provides a deep understanding of each student’s individual strengths, needs, motivations, progress and goals. These profiles are updated far more often than a standard report card. And these detailed updates help teachers make decisions to positively impact student learning.A learner profile also helps students keep track of their own progress. It gives the teacher, the student and, in many schools, the parent a way to know if they need to change a learning method or make changes to goals — before the student does poorly or fails.2. Schools that use personalized learning paths. This type of school helps each student customize a learning path that responds or adapts based on progress, motivations, and goals. For instance, a school might create a student’s schedule based on weekly updates about academic progress and interests.Each student’s schedule is unique. But it’s likely to include several learning methods. (These are often called modalities.) The mix might include project-based learning with a small group of peers, independent work on certain skills or complex tasks, and one-on-one tutoring with a teacher.A personalized learning path allows a student to work on different skills at different paces. But that doesn’t mean the school will let a student fall far behind in any area. Teachers closely monitor each student and provide extra support as needed.3. Schools that use competency-based progression. This type of school continually assesses students to monitor their progress toward specific goals. This system makes it clear to students what they need to master. These competencies include specific skills, knowledge and mindsets like developing resilience.Students are given options of how and when to demonstrate their mastery. For example, a student might work with a teacher to weave certain math skills into an internship at a retail store.The student might work on several competencies at the same time. When they master one, they move on to the next. Each student gets the necessary support or services to help master the skills. The emphasis isn’t on taking a test and getting a passing or failing grade. Instead, it’s about continuous learning and having many chances to show knowledge.4. Schools using flexible learning environments. This type of school adapts the environment students learn in, based on how they learn best. That includes things like the physical setup of the class, how the school day is structured and how the teachers are allocated.For example, schools might look for ways to give teachers more time for small group instruction. It’s not easy to redesign the way teachers use space, time and resources in the classroom. But this type of design thinking can help student needs reshape the learning environment.The potential of personalized learningPersonalized learning isn’t widely used in schools yet. Many aspects still need to be explored. But this approach has the potential to help reduce the stigma of special education and better meet the needs of kids with learning and thinking differences.IEPs are too often focused mainly on deficits. But personalized learning paths can balance that by focusing on students’ strengths and interests. Together, IEPs and personalized learning can give kids the supports to work on weaknesses and a customized path that engages their interests and helps them “own” their learning.Personalized learning can also give students the chance to build self-advocacy skills. It encourages them to speak up about what interests them. It also allows them to be equal partners in their learning experience.Personalized learning has a lot of potential, but it also has some risks. Teachers might not have enough inclusion training to make this approach accessible to all students. They might not know how to support kids with executive function challenges. They might not know how to track competencies or analyze other kinds of student data.The key is to make sure that when schools start using personalized learning, teachers have the training to meet your child’s needs. And the more you know, the more involved you can be in the conversation.Ready for more information?

By Benjamin Herold — November 05, 2019 7 min read Share article Remove Save to favorites Save to favorites Print Email Facebook LinkedIn Twitter Copy URL Is it going to transform public schools, finally bringing education into the age of digitally driven personalization embodied by companies such as Amazon and Netflix? Or is it a billionaire-backed boondoggle, aimed primarily at replacing teachers and extracting data from children? When it comes to “personalized learning,” there’s no shortage of hyperbole from either proponents or critics.Here’s what you need to know about the realities of one of the biggest, most controversial trends in K-12 education—starting with the most difficult question first. What exactly is personalized learning? Inside K-12 schools, the term is used to mean just about anything. For many educators, it’s about using adaptive software that adjusts to each student’s skill level. Sometimes, it’s about the systematic use of digital data to inform big decisions, like how to group students. Other schools focus on giving students more say over what projects they undertake, or how they present their work. And increasingly, personalized-learning proponents also take a much wider lens, saying schools must nurture each individual child’s social, emotional, and physical development.Some see such scattered and nebulous definitions as reason to worry that personalized learning will go the way of other short-lived reforms. Others are more positive.“In the same way that Inuits have lots of different words for ‘snow,’ I think these are all personalized learning,” says Larry Berger, the CEO of ed-tech company Amplify and a leading thinker and writer on the topic for over a decade. What’s the hope behind the movement? Very broadly speaking, the idea is to customize the learning experience for each student according to his or her unique skills, abilities, preferences, background, and experiences. The hope is that will improve a wide range of student outcomes, from engagement to achievement to wellbeing.Personalized-learning pioneer Dianne Tavenner told Education Week in 2017 that it’s about the type of education good teachers have always envisioned, but haven’t always had the tools to make a reality.“Personalized learning is a way to actually enact the pedagogy we believe in and that kids thrive in,” said Tavenner, the founder of Summit Public Schools, a California-based charter network that operates about a dozen of its own personalized-learning schools while licensing its personalized-learning software to hundreds of others. So is this a new idea or not? Not really.The personalized learning movement has two primary wings, each of which is grounded in decades-old (and often warring) philosophies about how children learn. The so-called “engineering model” of personalized learning emphasizes efficient mastery of academic content. The idea is that experts can map out what each child needs to learn, measure what of that each already knows, and then create the optimal path for him or her to learn the rest.Other approaches to personalized learning are rooted in progressive education traditions. This wing of the movement generally holds that learning happens when schools tap into students’ interests and passions, giving them individualized opportunities to ask questions and explore and take risks. The former approach dates at least back to the 1950s, when psychologist B.F. Skinner was experimenting with “teaching machines” intended to let students answer questions and receive feedback at their own pace. The latter goes back more than a century, to John Dewey. It’s often seen today in schools that emphasize more project-based learning.In both cases, what is new is the way in which technology—from big data to online collaboration tools to social media—is being used to amplify methods educators have been using more or less forever. Where did the new push for personalized learning come from? Big-picture, it’s a reflection of deeper trends in both society and the K-12 sector.Technology has already transformed other sectors of society, such as retail. Often, this has taken the form of using digital data to learn more about individuals and their preferences, then target them with information, advertisements, and recommendations. In part, personalized learning is a reflection of the push to apply those tools and ideas to education.It’s also emerged out of rising opposition to standardized tests and the so-called “factory model of education,” which critics contend has left both children and teachers feeling like widgets inside the classroom. These broad forces started to come together in tangible form roughly a decade ago.Beginning around 2009, for example, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation began committing hundreds of millions of dollars to support research and development around personalized learning. Then, under President Obama, the U.S. Education Department gave half a billion dollars to encourage districts to embrace the trend, primarily via its competitive-grant program known as Race to the Top. More recently, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, the venture-philanthropy group started by Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, pediatrician Priscilla Chan, has vowed to give hundreds of millions of dollars per year in support of its vision for “whole-child personalized learning,” encompassing students’ emotional and physical development as well as their academic learning.States, companies, other philanthropies, and a network of nonprofits and advocacy groups are also now backing the movement. Do personalized learning strategies work? Oh yeah. Big-time.In 2018, for example, the Education Week Research Center conducted a nationally representative survey of the country’s school principals.More than half characterized personalized learning as either a “transformational way to improve public education” or a “promising idea.”A whopping 97 percent said their schools were using digital technologies to personalize learning in some form or fashion. Does personalized learning work? That’s precisely the wrong question to ask.John Pane, a senior scientist at the RAND Corporation and a leading researcher of the personalized learning movement says the reason why goes back to the incredible variation in how personalized learning actually happens inside real classrooms.“At this stage, we really need to be looking at the actual components of what people are trying to do and assess them each on their own,” Pane said.That’s an argument that proponents generally embrace. They point to the strong research base for some of the core building blocks of most personalized-learning models, including providing students with differentiated instruction and real-time feedback.Some studies of specific personalized-learning products, used in particular situations and under particular circumstances, have also yielded promising signs.But other such studies have shown small or even negative results. And what about personalized-learning models that seek to transform entire schools? Experts estimate there are maybe 1,000 or so such schools in the country. How are they doing?Summit is one of the best-known, best-funded examples, having received more than $40 million from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative. But Tavenner’s group has declined to undergo independent third-party evaluation.The results for other models that have been studied are generally not great.“The evidence base is very weak at this point,” said Pane, who led a Gates-funded study of about 40 personalized-learning schools, finding modest gains and big implementation challenges. Are there other arguments against personalized learning? You betcha. Critics such as independent researcher Audrey Watters warn that personalized learning is a pretext for “massive data collection” and surveillance of students. They point to the rapid adoption of analogous technologies in other sectors (think, for example, Facebook), before the unintended and adverse privacy-related consequences we are now seeing could be ironed out. That 2018 Education Week Research Center survey also found that a strong majority of the nation’s principals worried that the trend was leading to too much screen time for students (85 percent expressed “some,” “a lot” or “a great deal” of concern), students working alone too often (77 percent), and the tech industry gaining too much influence over public education (67 percent.) Where does all that leave schools? Pane and his team at RAND say K-12 educators, administrators, and policymakers are in the unenviable position of having to make high-stakes educational decisions with “imperfect evidence.”That doesn’t mean they should stick their heads in the sand, the RAND team said. Personalized learning holds promise. Careful, cautious attempts at some elements of the trend may make sense. Stick to common sense and the evidence we do have, they advise. Resist pressure to throw out established practices that work just because they’re not new and shiny. But think twice before diving in.“I would not advise schools to dump massive resources into going fully into personalized learning,” Laura S. Hamilton, a senior behavioral scientist and distinguished chair in learning and assessment at the RAND Corporation, told Education Week in 2017. “Experiment with some new approaches that might be a good fit for your particular school or district, but monitor it very closely.” Benjamin Herold Contributing Writer, Education Week Benjamin Herold was a contributing writer who covered learning environments and ed-tech issues for Education Week.

Overview[edit] The use of the term \"personalized learning\" dates back to at least the early 1960s,[1] but there is no widespread agreement on the definition and components of a personal learning environment.[2] Even enthusiasts for the concept admit that personal learning is an evolving term and doesn\\'t have any widely accepted definition.[3] In 2005, Dan Buckley defined two ends of the personalized learning spectrum: \"personalization for the learner\", in which the teacher tailors the learning, and \"personalization by the learner\", in which the learner develops skills to tailor his own learning. This spectrum was adopted by the (2006) Microsoft\\'s Practical Guide to Envisioning and Transforming Education.[4] Definitions[edit] The United States National Education Technology Plan 2017 defines personalized learning as follows: Personalized learning refers to instruction in which the pace of learning and the instructional approach are optimized for the needs of each learner. Learning objectives, instructional approaches, and instructional content (and its sequencing) may all vary based on learner needs. In addition, learning activities are meaningful and relevant to learners, driven by their interests, and often self-initiated.[5] Typically technology is used to try to facilitate personalized learning environments.[6] According to researcher Eduard Pogorskiy: ICT can be a powerful tool for personalized learning as it allows learners access to research and information, and provides a mechanism for communication, debate, and recording learning achievements. However, personalized learning is not exclusive to digital technologies or environments. In the rhetoric around 21st Century Skills, personalized learning is often equated with \\'customization\\' (as found in the business world), with digital personalization used to frame the learning experience as highly efficient. Problematic in this is the discounting of the highly relational and socially constructed space well defined in the research on learning. Narrowing personalized learning to its digital form also raises the concern of the echo chamber effect emerging in (hyper)personalized online experiences.[7] Instructional design[edit] Proponents of personalized learning say that many elements of curriculum, assessment, and instructional design must be present in classrooms for students to succeed and often use software systems to manage and facilitate student-led instruction. Proponents argue that classroom learning activities must build upon students\\' prior knowledge and teachers need to allocate time for practice. Advocates argue that teachers must continuously assess student learning against clearly defined standards and goals, and student input into the assessment process is integral.[8][9][10] Conferring[edit] As stated above by the 2017 United States National Education Technology Plan, \"Personalized learning refers to instruction in which the pace of learning and the instructional approach are optimized the needs for each learner.\" Conferring is a process in which this can be accomplished. Conferring, as defined by Julie Kallio, is a \"regular, goal-oriented meeting between the teacher and student(s) where they talk about learning progress, process, and/or products.\" Conferring, more simply, is a way to provide more personalized feedback. Learning, in any context, requires some form of feedback. In schools, this feedback is almost entirely thought of as the teacher providing feedback to the student. The idea of providing feedback to advance student learning is best understood in the framework of the \"zone of proximal development\" or ZPD.[11] Psychologist Lev Vygotski has defined the ZPD as \"the distance between the actual developmental level as determined by independent problem solving and the level of potential development as determined through problem solving under adult guidance or in collaboration with more capable peers\".[11] More plainly, a student has a certain level they can achieve by themselves and with support they are able to achieve a higher level of learning. However, there is still some level in which the student is incapable of reaching, no matter what support is provided. For example, a student may be working on double digit addition. Their current knowledge may already provide them with the skills to move on to triple digit addition without any help. If the student is introduced to multiplication, however, they will need help to understand that multiplication is a quicker way to represent the same number being added onto itself a defined number of times. Where this help occurs is the student\\'s ZPD. Even with help though, it is not reasonable to expect the student to learn how to solve a calculus problem. The struggle for teachers is how to provide the right amount of help to each student. If a teacher provides information to the whole class too quickly, some students are left behind trying to figure out the first step. Conversely, if a teacher provides information to the whole class too slowly, some students will finish rapidly and be left with nothing to do. Conferring is a tool that teachers have used to help mitigate that issue. Conferring first gained prominence in the book One to one: the art of conferring with young writers by Lucy Calkins, Amanda Hartman, and Zoe Ryder White.[12] In the work, Calkins and her co-writers describe how effective writing workshops for students included individual writing conferences (conferring), where teachers would sit and talk with their students about their writing. Per the book, \"Conferring can give us the force that makes our mini-lessons and curriculum development and assessment and everything else more powerful. It gives us an endless resource of teaching wisdom, an endless source of accountability, a system of checks and balances. And, it gives us laughter and human connection -the understanding of our children that gives spirit to our teaching.\"[12] Calkins believed that there were three main components to every conferring session: Research, Decide, and Teach. Research focused on where the student was in their current writing, Decide would help the teacher choose what to teach the student, and Teach would use modeling and guiding practice to further advance student learning. In their book The Writing Workshop, Katie Wood Ray and Lester L. Laminack added a fourth component in where after the teaching portion, the student and/or the teacher would \"Make a Record\".[13] This modified model can be thought in the terms of: research, decide, teach, record. The benefits of using conferring have been documented in a couple of studies. Using a mix method case study approach in observing a group of 4th grade students, Javaye Devette Stubbs posed the question: \"How does the implementation of one-on-one conferring promote higher order thinking skills in students with difficulties in reading?\"[14] The results from her pre and post-test found that \"even those with reading difficulties did show a significant gain in higher order thinking skills\".[14] In a separate study, the educator Antony Smith examined the effectiveness of using teacher-student writing conference for English language learners (ELLs).[15] Observing two students who were ELLs in a second-grade classroom working on a book project, Smith found that the work produced \"looks similar to what is produced by native English speakers\".[15] Smith later suggests that the success of the two students were largely tied to the writing conferences, and goes on to state that writing conferences are the \"heart of the writing process, and with this in mind, the potential of the teacher-student writing conference becomes clear\".[15] The information can be summarized into three main takeaways. First, building student knowledge is dependent on the current level of knowledge the student has and what kind of support they are provided. Second, conferring is a model that can provide student support through a structured four-part process. Third, conferring has been shown to increase student learning in both reading and writing. Debate[edit] Andy Hargreaves and Dennis Shirley write that while there are advantages in students being able to access information instantly on-line, one should not mistake such processes for \"something deeper, more challenging, and more connected to compelling issues in their world and their lives\".[16] Alfie Kohn wrote that while personalized learning may sound like a useful strategy for education, in practice it is mostly just about selling technology products. Personalized learning promises a strategy to specifically adjust education to the unique needs and skills of individual children, he argued, but really it means merely \"adjusting the difficulty level of prefabricated skills-based exercises based on students\\' test scores... [and] requires the purchase of software from one of those companies that can afford full-page ads in Education Week\". While \"certain forms of technology can be used to support progressive education\", Kohn wrote, \"...meaningful (and truly personal) learning never requires technology. Therefore, if an idea like personalization is presented from the start as entailing software or a screen, we ought to be extremely skeptical about who really benefits.\"[17] Next steps for research[edit] Dr. Ces\\'Ari Garcia-Delmuro advocated in her research on personalized learning for other researchers to continue including teacher voice in their studies of personalized learning programs as a way to improve these programs for teachers and students.[18] She said more studies should be conducted that focus on other low SES schools implementing personalized learning. Furthermore, donors that are giving to the advancement of personalized learning need to consult new research to ensure that they are donating to programs that benefit all students including those who belong to vulnerable populations (students in special education, bilingual emergent students, and students of low socioeconomic status), not just those students who are able to self-direct. In future research, it is important to continue to study these schools who are piloting personalized learning to see how their needs change over time. Because these programs are still relatively new, it would be helpful to understand the perceptions of teachers who are using these programs for five years or longer to continue assisting teacher and school sites as they mature in their personalized learning use. Additionally, research which compares teacher perception of personalized learning compared to student academic outcomes will be helpful once schools new to personalized learning overcome their fifth year of implementation.

Using AI For Personalized Learning Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a familiar buzzword that we like to use whenever the chance arises. Personalized learning is a way to use AI that focuses on making training fit the needs of each individual student. One way to see what it can do is to look at it through the lens of specialized training. Personalized learning means that each student's learning experience is tailored to fit their needs. Personalized learning lets each person's wants and learning goals be met by changing things like the speed at which they learn, the materials they use, the order in which they learn them, the technologies they use, the quality of the materials, the way they are taught, and the materials they use to learn. Still, large-scale personalization might not be possible without Artificial Intelligence technology. By using AI for personalized learning, learners can receive training at their own pace and when it's most convenient for them. AI technology helps predict how people will learn, so you can make material that fits each learner's goals and past successes. Artificial Intelligence is playing a significant role in personalizing education for every student. By leveraging AI technologies, educators can tailor learning experiences to meet the individual needs, preferences, and learning styles of students. Ways AI Can Be Utilized To Personalize Education Adaptive Learning AI-powered adaptive learning platforms analyze student data, such as their performance, strengths, weaknesses, and learning pace. Based on this information, the system can provide personalized learning pathways for each student, offering appropriate content, resources, and activities that align with their specific needs. Intelligent Tutoring Systems AI-driven tutoring systems provide individualized guidance and support to students. These systems can assess student understanding, identify areas of difficulty, and offer targeted explanations, feedback, and practice exercises. They adapt to each student's progress and adjust the learning material accordingly. Personalized Recommendations AI algorithms can analyze vast amounts of data, including a student's past performance, interests, and goals, to generate personalized recommendations for educational resources, books, articles, videos, and other learning materials. This helps students discover relevant content that matches their specific needs and preferences. Natural Language Processing AI-powered natural language processing (NLP) allows for the development of intelligent chatbots and virtual assistants that can interact with students in a conversational manner. These AI assistants can answer questions, provide explanations, offer feedback, and engage in dialogue to enhance the learning experience. Data-Driven Insights AI enables educators to gather and analyze large amounts of student data, such as assessment results, engagement levels, and behavior patterns. By extracting meaningful insights from this data, teachers can gain a deeper understanding of individual students and make informed decisions to personalize their learning experiences effectively. Multimodal Learning AI technologies facilitate multimodal learning experiences by incorporating various formats, such as text, audio, video, and interactive elements. This allows students to engage with content in ways that suit their learning preferences, making the educational experience more personalized and engaging. Personalized Assessment and Feedback AI can automate the assessment process and provide timely, personalized feedback to students. Intelligent grading systems can evaluate assignments, quizzes, and exams, enabling faster feedback delivery. This helps students identify their areas of improvement and provides targeted suggestions for further learning. Individualized Learning Paths AI-powered platforms can generate individualized learning paths for students based on their goals, interests, and prior knowledge. By adapting the curriculum and pace to meet the needs of each student, AI ensures that they receive appropriate challenges and support, maximizing their learning outcomes. It's important to note that while AI offers tremendous potential for personalizing education, human teachers remain crucial in creating supportive and inspiring learning environments. The combination of AI and human expertise can lead to more effective and personalized education for every student. Conclusion AI can be used to keep an eye on other important problems in education. Since there aren't enough teachers, using AI to make learning more specialized will help fill in some of the gaps in high-quality education. Personalized learning is all about giving the student control over how they want to learn and giving them the chance to learn at their own pace and when it's most convenient for them. Artificial Intelligence makes it possible for learners to choose the way they want to learn. Also, using AI for targeted learning lets you quickly figure out what skills your students already know. You can also figure out what they want to learn.

Benefits of personalized learning Examples of personalized learning A new era of personalized learning with AI How to get started with personalized learning in organizations How can learning be made even more personalized and effective? How can modern technologies help with personalized learning? How do you make a personalized learning plan? Conclusion What is personalized learning? Personalized learning is the customization and adaptation of educational methods and techniques so that the learning process is better suited for each individual learner, with their own unique learning style, background, needs, and previous experiences. Learning can happen in a myriad of different places, activities, methods, and time frames. From the lecture hall populated with hundreds of learners listening to an instructor to a one-on-one mentorship program, from interactive online games to complex technical textbooks, there are so many formats that learning can take. There are many different learning techniques, as well as many styles of teaching and learning, all of which combine to make every learning experience different and personalized. Each type of learning has pros and cons and will offer different things to different learners. In a personalized learning approach, the learner’s personal experience, knowledge, and habits are connected with learning methods, so that they can learn faster, understand new concepts more easily, and improve their learning performance. How does personalized learning work? Personalized learning centers around the task of connecting a learner’s previous knowledge, experiences, and abilities with training materials that will link that understanding with new information. The simplest example of personalized learning would be when an instructor provides learning material with proper content and context, and in the best way for the learner. This is done by using the existing knowledge that the instructor has of the student. The instructor understands how best to connect the learner’s previous experiences and abilities to the new information, building links between existing knowledge and new information. Proper learning material is content that is relevant to the learner’s previous experiences. The best way, for each learner, is delivery of information in such a way that the learner is able to acquire the new information easily. This could be the type of material (video, text, or interactive games, for example), the time spent, the amount of material covered in each session, and the order in which new information is explained. This will vary for each learner, as everyone has different learning styles. This, of course, is not a scalable solution, but it is the simplest explanation of how personalized learning can be actioned. It is a process of connection, of delivering the right tools to assist the learning path. Nowadays, to make this type of approach happen, and more importantly, be scalable, organizations need to be able to create a digital learning infrastructure that can automate this process and make it cost-effective. To do so, organizations need to use a variety of digital solutions. These can include communication channels (e.g. Slack), AI technologies (e.g. machine learning and automation), data analysis, learning platforms, mobile technologies, and more. Only by creating a system using the many available tools can an organization better understand the needs of each individual learner, and deliver the content that they need, when they need it, in a truly scalable and organized fashion. Let’s take a look at how this would work in practice. Meet Jeff, your new employee. You know the following information about Jeff: He has an engineering degree. His previous work experience was as a senior engineer at a construction company. He prefers to consume video content rather than read. He enjoys using technology, and quite often uses mobile devices in his work. Develop and maintain a strategy-driven learning cultureUpgrade your organization’s learning culture with clear, actionable strategies to address the challenges. Learn more Some learner profiles will have more variables, but let’s start with this. So based on those parameters, a learning instructor would create a specific learning path for Jeff. The path that will be based on his education (comfortable with high-level educational content), experience (connecting information to what a senior engineer would know), and preferred content type (video) and will deliver it on the go, so Jeff can engage with content on mobile devices. So this is how personalized learning looks like and works. Why is personalized learning important? If an organization wants to improve learning outcomes, personalized learning is a proven way to do so. By taking data related to a learner’s previous experience and linking that to new concepts, personalized learning results in a more complete understanding of new concepts, better engagement, and knowledge retention is improved. In short, personalized learning makes learning more effective. By looking at the previous example, you can see how personalized learning can transform a common training program and make it more personalized for each unique user. Such changes make the learning process engaging, faster, and more effective. Even making learning content slightly personalized will make a difference, for example, removing material that is unnecessary while highlighting the training that will help the learner most. As technology advances, learners become more demanding, and they expect training programs to keep up. Nowadays, personalized content is everywhere. We have personalized feeds on social media, personal playlists, movie recommendations, and a lot of other things. We already expect that any new tool will have something similar. At work, we expect that the learning platform will offer us something new, relevant exactly for us. Without updating the way that learning is delivered, organizations run the risk of disengaging employees in a vital area. Not only that, consider what a new employee will think if they begin their onboarding process with a company that uses an outdated, non-personalized approach to training. Will they trust that this organization can help them upskill throughout their career? Will they take the organization seriously as a competitive and forward-thinking company to work for? Employees consistently report that they look for jobs that will offer training and opportunities for growth, and will stay longer in roles that provide them. As employees learn, they are able to improve their performance, delivering better business results. Good employee training programs can increase revenue, boost productivity, and breed innovation within an organization. As more organizations face the challenge of upskilling workers effectively and efficiently, personalized learning has come into the spotlight as a method that can deliver that in a scalable manner. Benefits of personalized learning 1. Saves time Personalized learning cuts down on the time it takes a learner to engage with and understand a new subject. It also serves to remove content that is no longer relevant or would be redundant due to the experience level of the learner, saving time that would otherwise be wasted on learning concepts that will not serve the learner. 2. Increases engagement When content is both relevant and personalized, learning is more engaging. A learner is more likely to interact with, and remember content that targets their current role, projects, or area of work. 3. Improves knowledge retention When content is based on previous experience, the learner will retain that information for a much longer period of time. When a personalized learning path connects each piece of the puzzle together, with each piece supporting each other to intertwine the information, the learner will be able to better recall information by linking it to existing knowledge. 4. Increased motivation Learning that is connected to something relevant, be it the learner, their job, or their hobbies will increase motivation for the learner. This is especially true if the content contains tips or helpful information that is immediately actionable. 5. Improves learning results Studies have shown that a personalized learning approach yields better learning results. This approach elevates learning and provides content that is relevant, engaging, actionable, and memorable. The end result is a learner who is pleased with their interaction with the material and is better at their job. Examples of personalized learning 1. One-on-one Tutoring In a situation where you have two individuals, a learner, and a teacher, you need the teacher to understand exactly what the learner already knows, and then tie that to new information. Consider this example of a parent teaching a child about cars: Recently my son asked me “what is this and what do you need it for?” about the gearshift in my manual transmission car. After thinking about it a moment, I explained it to him by talking about his bike’s shifter and gear mechanisms, which allow him to change the speed/effort ratio. I then connected the concept of those mechanisms to the gearshift in my car. By knowing something from my son’s previous experience and linking new information to that, I made this new concept easy for him to learn. What if the parent chose to explain this concept using diagrams of engines and gearboxes, talking in high-level mechanical engineering language? The kid would have checked out immediately, as he would have been unable to connect this new information to what he already knew. No learning would happen, and the child likely wouldn’t ask any more questions like this to his parent, as he has learned that the answer will be incomprehensible. This is how one-on-one personalized learning can be achieved by creatively using what is already known about the learner, and linking that to new information. 2. Mentoring One of the well-known ways of personalized learning is mentoring. The more experienced employee is assigned as an adviser to the less experienced employee. With all knowledge that the mentor gathered by experiencing something in the past, he could understand the issues and difficulties that the mentee is facing and guide the learning towards understanding. This model works great, but its limitation is in its scalability.

Online course providers You have definitely seen these type of courses, and very probably used one yourself. Coursera, edX, Linkedin Learning, OpenSesame, and many, many others. In all of those services, you have a personal account that the system tracks and stores all of your learning data in order to offer you new relevant courses. When you finish one course, the platform will offer you advanced courses or materials relevant to the subject. 4. Search engines Search engines are the most popular way of personalized learning. Google answers your questions with personalized answers. If you like to read, you might order books online, or visit some publication sites to find a new book, Google will remember that. So if you google “Harry Potter”, the system will offer you the best offers from online book shops. At the same time, if you like to watch movies, and do it quite often online, you will see movie-related answers. Even the subject is the same, “Harry Potter”, Google knows that the subject contains a different type of information. Knowledge Graph, the technology behind that, connects different aspects of the subjects together. So, in the end, you can see the results that are most relevant to you. Harry Potter is a book, movie, character, and you even will see pictures and profiles of Daniel Radcliffe, the actor who played the character. All of this happened because Google wants to provide the most relevant information to the users as possible, and uses personalized learning to do so. 5. Corporate training example Air Methods, a Colorado-based helicopter medical transport company used personalized learning to boost their pilot training program. Using a cloud-based learning system, they turned to artificial intelligence to pinpoint the topics in which pilots were struggling and present more information and differently worded questions to ensure that pilots truly knew the topic. By using frequent, short quizzes and games, the pilots were engaged and the organization was easily able to pinpoint areas where more training was needed. This use of personalized learning allowed the company to cut in-person, instructor-led training sessions in half, and also reduced the number of days needed for onboarding, from ten to five days. A new era of personalized learning with AI As artificial intelligence technologies become more advanced, more able to distinguish individual needs, and more customizable, their use in personalized learning has increased. The two biggest components of a successful personalized learning program are data and AI, specifically machine learning. By using data, an organization can teach AI to recognize patterns, make connections between information and knowledge, and provide the correct information at the right time to the user. The biggest hurdle in this is collecting and analyzing data about employees. How to get started with personalized learning in organizations So, what should an organization do if they want to implement personalized learning? How can a business help an employee to not only find out the information they need but to also ensure the answer is linked to their previous experience? The answer is a combination of sophisticated search and personalization engines. First, a search engine will narrow the possible sources of information, like documents, web pages, or training materials, and then a personalization engine will prioritize the content that is most relevant to the employee’s previous experience. The search engine is something that we are accustomed to using every day, like Google. In a corporate environment, it could be a separate engine for each information system or some sort of more advanced engine that is able to query many different backend systems and combine results. But how can an organization make those results more personalized, e.g. related to the employee’s previous experience? Or to be even more precise, how do we know what is the employee’s previous experience? How can an employee’s experience be digitalized? 1) The first step in that direction is to list for each employee what skills they have learned previously and what is their level of knowledge. It could be done, for example, by analyzing their CV using text analytics or by asking them to fill in a simple form with skills in rows and knowledge levels in columns (skills matrix). This information already gives some clues, but not with much detail, though. In addition, this is a pretty much static view, which doesn’t take into account the learning and experiences happening after those skills had been listed. 2) In the second step, in addition to the Competence Matrix, collected in the previous step, HR needs to collect information about training attended, certifications achieved, and everything else related to formal learning. For the employee, this could improve the relevance of the information found significantly, as the level of their knowledge is known to the system and is updated in accordance with formal learning attended. As a result, for example, expert-level information will not be shown to the novice and vice versa. Still, that is not enough to make search results truly relevant and personal. The personalization engine needs much more granular information about what the employee knows, how they prefer to learn, what is easy, and what is difficult for them, what type of information suits them best, and so on. 3) The third, much more advanced, step is to combine the approaches already described with the collection of information about all learning activities happening in real-time. We are talking about using the Experience API (xAPI) in combination with the Learning Record Store (LRS). With xAPI it is possible to collect information about the employee’s learning happening in many places and with a great degree of detail. If the company intranet is xAPI enabled, it is possible to collect information about opened pages and downloaded documents. If the employee’s actions in a factory are tracked with some sensors, those could be collected as xAPI statements. If a company uses simulations or Virtual/Augmented Reality (VR/AR) for training, actions, and events inside the simulation could be tracked and stored as xAPI statements. If a company uses a Learning Experience Platform, like Valamis, for delivery of its training, all the user’s actions are automatically tracked with xAPI. How to make learning even more personalized and effective? When all that information about the employee is available to the personalization engine, it could make much more justified guesses about the relevance of some information for the employee. By analyzing the learning history, it could become clear what learning format is most suitable for the person. For example, does reading an article contribute more to the learning than audio, do they prefer longer learning sessions with broad context presented or should it be short and directly to the subject, or do learning needs vary depending on the time of day or day of the week? Even more relevant results could be produced when the employee’s knowledge and experience are compared to other employees’ experiences and similarities found in roles, skills, or learning activities. Then the relevance of the information provided to the employee could be improved based on that similarity. This also works well for a new employee who has no previous history in a company. At first, similarities like role and department as well as an absence of previous learning history could bring them relevant onboarding materials, and then by analyzing the history of the previous newcomers, a recommendation engine will be feeding the learner with suggestions that are already proven to be relevant to those who came and went through onboarding materials before. Needless to say, it is not the end of the story, it is only just the beginning. To bring it to the next level, the loop must be closed and learning should be applied to the personalization engine to produce better relevance over time. Analyzing learning activities, checking what employees were choosing themselves from results suggested, asking if they were satisfied with results provided, looking into refined searches – all that will make the recommendation engine improve and adapt all the time using machine learning. How modern technologies can help with personalized learning? There are many tools available, with more being developed every year, that are helping refine and redefine what personalized learning is. Recommendations Much like the ‘recommended for you’ section of Netflix is powered by an algorithm that looks at what you have enjoyed previously and delivers new content based on that information, recommendations can be used to seamlessly queue up learning content that is tailored to the individual learner’s needs and role, and helps identify and prevent skill gaps. AI assistant Using an AI assistant frees up instructors to serve the immediate learning needs of each individual by taking over the curation and recommendation of material. An AI assistant knows the learner’s data, including what their skills are, the learning path that they are following, and delivers curated suggestions as to what the learner should engage with next. Flexible learning paths Each person learns differently and has a different level of base knowledge about a subject. If a company uses a strict learning path, there is a chance that information already known is repeated, the information needed is not delivered, and the learner will disengage. By using a flexible learning path, the learner is offered information adapted specifically to them by technology. Information already known is automatically excluded or touched on in a cursory manner as a revision, the relevant information is delivered in a fashion tailored to the learner, and advanced content is offered to high-level learners. Natural Language Processing (NLP) Natural language processing can be used to make searches for information better, faster, and more precise. By accessing the power of NLP, learners can search for the exact information they need, whether in text or video and find exactly the answers they need to any question that they might have. How to create a personalized learning plan? To properly harness the power of this type of information delivery, a personalized learning plan should be implemented. Personalized learning plan is a document that includes the short and long-term goals of the learner, covers their strengths, weaknesses, skills, and knowledge gaps, and sets out the learning plan that is best for that particular learner. It is the roadmap that the learner will follow to reach their educational or training goals. 1. Assess A personalized learning plan always begins with an assessment. To know where you want to go, you must know where you are starting from! Assessments can be made for specific roles or at a team or departmental level and can be used for several employees at the same time. They should assess what information should be known, at what level, and should be able to identify specific knowledge gaps. Once the learner has completed their assessment, this data can be input into the system, and the development of a learning plan can begin. The same is true on a departmental and company-wide level. Data from teams can highlight the areas of weakness in a department, and show where their strengths are. 2. Determine the goals and skills needed for each specific role Now that you know where you are starting from, you must next decide where you are heading. It should be determined which skills or competencies are needed for each role or department. By doing so, an organization is able to create or modify learning materials to develop or improve those skills. Goals and skills should be created according to the SMART method, so that the learner’s, or the departments, progress in reaching them can be more easily tracked. 3. Create a generic learning plan You have gathered data on the current level of employee’s knowledge and skills, and identified what they need to learn. The next step is developing the path to get them there. A learning plan should be developed. This doesn’t need to be hyper-specific – a generic series of steps that take the learner from point A to point B will suffice, and data will be gathered as more learners use this path to help personalize it for future learners. 4. Map learning modalities Working to understand how the learner interacts with learning materials, and which materials will work best for this particular person is an important aspect of personalized learning. Do they prefer video content? Perhaps they are more comfortable working with text and mini-quizzes. Each person will have preferences for how they engage with the material, and this should be discovered at this step. As it is discovered what works best for each person, this information should be mapped. It is also good, at this stage, to create learner profiles. This profile not only can show the path of the individual learner and their accomplishments, but it can also serve as a blueprint for other learners in similar roles. Understanding how each learner has been successful can be valuable data for a training program. 5. Modify learning plans for individuals according to their specific preferences By customizing the learning plan, using data about the learner’s specific knowledge level, preference of content, and many other factors, an organization can ensure that learners are engaged, gaining skills, and not wasting their time on unnecessary content. 6. Utilize assessments to track learning Recurring check-ins through assessments should be implemented to ensure that the learning path is successful. These assessments, both one-on-one and self, should then deliver data to be analyzed that will help give a window into the learner’s journey. One-on-one assessments are important here, as they allow for feedback, problem-solving, goal restructuring, and many other positive actions that can help learners be supported in reaching their goals. A personalized learning plan is driven by this data, and the more data that there is, the more responsive it can be. 7. Review and scale Throughout the program, the organization should review the process, continually work to improve the overall learner experience and make sure that the process itself is optimized. This is also where an organization can update or scale a program. Conclusion Making learning personalized has a great impact on learning outcomes. When new concepts are linked to a person’s previous experience, it results in better understanding, and learning becomes more effective. In an organizational environment, the creation of personalized learning requires technology solutions to make it cost-effective and scalable. Technology, like a combination of Experience API (xAPI) and Learning Record Store (LRS), enables the collection of an employee’s experiences on a very granular level in digital form. This information could be then leveraged in building a personalized learning experience in future learning activities using a combination of sophisticated search and personalized engines. Of course, none of the technology solutions is perfect, but by closing the feedback loop from a learner’s activities back to the solution, the quality of answers given to a learner will be constantly improving. Having that, instead of “figure out yourself” type of learning, employees could enjoy and experience truly personalized learning.

Personalized Learning: A Comprehensive Guide For Online Instructors The term \"personalized learning\" has long been gaining popularity in online education. Personalized learning is an instructional approach that tailors educational content and teaching methods to meet individual learners\\' unique needs and preferences. This approach emphasizes the development of learner-centered teaching strategies that promote self-directed and collaborative learning. This article will explore personalized learning in-depth, including how it differs from traditional online learning, how it can be delivered asynchronously and synchronously, how to redesign an existing online course to include personalized learning, and the pros and cons of this approach. We will also discuss determining whether personalized learning is the correct method for your online courses and programs. What Is Personalized Learning? Personalized learning is a teaching approach that considers each learner\\'s strengths, weaknesses, learning styles, and interests. The goal is to create a learning experience tailored to each student\\'s needs and abilities, which can lead to improved engagement, motivation, and learning outcomes. Personalized learning involves a shift in the traditional teaching paradigm from a teacher-centered approach to a learner-centered approach. Instead of being passive recipients of information, students are encouraged to take an active role in their learning by setting goals, tracking their progress, and reflecting on their learning. How Does It Differ From Traditional Online Learning? Traditional online learning typically involves a one-size-fits-all approach where all learners receive the same content and follow the same learning path. This approach is efficient in delivery, but it does not consider individual differences in learning styles, preferences, or prior knowledge. On the other hand, personalized learning allows learners to take an active role in their learning and receive content tailored to their individual needs. This can be achieved through adaptive learning technologies, data analytics, and other Instructional Design strategies. Asynchronous Vs. Synchronous Personalized Learning Personalized learning can be designed to be delivered asynchronously or synchronously, depending on the needs of the learners and the course objectives. Personalized asynchronous learning can be achieved through adaptive learning technologies that adjust the content and activities based on the learner\\'s progress and performance. On the other hand, personalized synchronous learning can be achieved through learning analytics that provides real-time feedback to the teacher on the learners\\' progress and performance. Redesigning Existing Online Courses For Personalized Learning If you already have an existing online course that you would like to redesign to include personalized learning, there are several steps you can take. Analyze the learners Identify the learners\\' needs, strengths and weaknesses, and their learning styles and preferences. Create personalized learning objectives Define personalized learning objectives that align with the course objectives and are tailored to the learners\\' needs. Develop personalized learning activities Design activities tailored to the learners\\' needs and preferences. This can include interactive simulations, case studies, and collaborative activities. Use adaptive learning technologies Adaptive learning technologies can be used to personalize the learning experience by adjusting the content and activities based on the learner\\'s performance. Pros And Cons Of Personalized Learning There are several advantages and disadvantages to personalized learning that you should consider before deciding if it is the right approach for your online courses and programs. Pros Improved engagement Personalized learning can enhance engagement by providing learners with content tailored to their interests and needs. This can increase their motivation to learn, leading to a more enjoyable and fulfilling learning experience. Better outcomes Personalized learning has been shown to lead to better learning outcomes, including higher retention rates and better assessment performance. This is because learners are more engaged and motivated, and the content better aligns with their needs and abilities. Flexible learning Personalized learning can be delivered asynchronously, allowing learners to access the content at their own pace and schedule. This flexibility can benefit learners with busy schedules or other commitments. Cons Resource-intensive Personalized learning can be resource-intensive, as it requires the development of individualized learning objectives, activities, and assessments. This can be time-consuming and expensive, particularly for larger courses or programs. Technical requirements Personalized learning often relies on adaptive learning technologies, which can require technical expertise and support. This can be a barrier for instructors and learners uncomfortable with technology. Is Personalized Learning The Right Method For Your Online Courses And Programs? Determining whether personalized learning is the proper method for your online courses and programs requires careful consideration of several factors, including: Learner needs Personalized learning is most effective when it meets individual learners\\' unique needs and preferences. Consider whether your learners would benefit from a more personalized approach and whether the resources are available to support this approach. Course objectives Personalized learning should be aligned with the course objectives and enhance learners\\' learning experience. Consider whether personalized learning would help you achieve your course objectives and whether it would be worth the additional resources required. Technical resources Personalized learning often requires adaptive learning technologies and other technical resources. Consider whether you have the technical expertise and support to implement this approach effectively. Ethical considerations Personalized learning often involves collecting and analyzing learner data, which raises ethical concerns. Consider whether you are comfortable with the data collection and analysis practices required for personalized learning. Conclusion Personalized learning is an instructional approach that tailors educational content and teaching methods to meet individual learners\\' unique needs and preferences. This approach emphasizes the development of learner-centered teaching strategies that promote self-directed and collaborative learning. Personalized learning differs from traditional online learning because it allows learners to learn and receive content tailored to their needs. Personalized learning can be designed to be delivered asynchronously or synchronously, depending on the needs of the learners and the course objectives. Redesigning an existing online course to include personalized learning requires careful consideration of learner needs, course objectives, technical resources, and ethical considerations. While personalized learning has several advantages, including improved engagement and better outcomes, it can also be resource-intensive and raise privacy concerns. Determining whether personalized learning is the correct method for your online courses and programs requires careful consideration of several factors, including learner needs, course objectives, technical resources, and ethical considerations. By considering these factors, instructors and institutions can design effective and engaging online courses that meet individual learners\\' unique needs and preferences.

Let\\'s be honest: as an academic term of art, personalized learning is horrible. It has almost no descriptive value. What does it mean to \"personalize\" learning? Isn\\'t learning, which is done by individual learners, inherently personal? What would it mean to personalize learning? And who would want unpersonalized learning? Because the term carries so little semantic weight, it is a natural for marketing purposes: \"Our personalized learning is new, improved, and 99.44% pure!\" Unfortunately, this also sets it up perfectly for the inevitable War of Definitions. Remember the Great MOOC War a few years ago? Were MOOCs the creation of the Canadian Constructivists or of the Stanford professor who invented a self-driving car? Are we talking about an xMOOC or a cMOOC? Which one is the good one, and which one is the bad one? Now that the furor has died down, there is relatively little debating over the definition of the term MOOC and much more focus on how the family of approaches that are collected under that term can best serve different educational purposes. Let\\'s just skip to the end this time, shall we? The two of us spent the past three years visiting colleges and universities that have undertaken so-called personalized learning projects, and we talked to the students, teachers, and administrators about what they are actually doing and why they are doing it. We visited a wide range of institutions and talked to a wide range of stakeholders, based on our daily work as consultants to colleges and universities and as analysts of the educational technology industry and our work on a grant funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Through these observations, we have been looking for the ground truth underneath the hype of personalized learning. As a result of this process, we observed a family of technology-enabled educational practices that are potentially useful for a range of educational challenges. We would like to share our framework, which we hope will be useful for thinking about (1) the circumstances under which personalized learning can help students and (2) the best way to evaluate the real educational value for products that are marketed under the personalized learning banner. e-Literate TV and the e-Literate Blog Many of our discussions with students, teachers, and administrators about personalized learning are documented in a series of rich-media case studies that we call e-Literate TV. The episodes include embedded links to more detailed content that is relevant to the conversations happening on-screen. Series home page [http://e-literate.tv/series/personalized-learning/] Overview episode [http://e-literate.tv/s3-intro/] for the series Blog posts on topics related to the series Most of our public writing, including additional analysis of e-Literate TV episodes, is shared on the e-Literate blog. Personalized Learning as Practice Imagine for a moment that personalized learning is not already a term in the ed tech lexicon and, further, that there is no need for any new term to be \"catchy\" or \"sticky.\" The most descriptive label we could come up with for the practices that the two of us have observed in our school visits might be undepersonalized teaching. If the ideal, most personal teaching modality is one-to-one tutoring, there are many reasons why we fall short of this ideal in real-world classrooms. The most stereotypical depersonalized teaching experience is the large lecture class, but there are many other situations in which teachers do not connect with individual students and/or meet the students\\' specific needs. For example, even a small class might contain students with a wide-enough range of skills, aptitudes, and needs that the teacher cannot possibly serve them all equally well. Or a student may have needs (or aptitudes) that the teacher simply doesn\\'t get an opportunity to see within the amount of contact time that the class allows. The truth is that students fall through the cracks all the time, even in the best classes taught by the best teachers. Failing a course is the most visible evidence, but more often students drift through the class and earn a passing grade—maybe even a good grade—without getting any lasting educational benefit. If we choose to think of personalized learning as a practice rather than a product, we can start by taking a hard look at course designs and identifying those areas that fail to make meaningful individual contact with students. These gaps will be different from course to course, subject to subject, student population to student population, and teacher to teacher. Although there is no generic answer to the question of where students are most likely to fall through the cracks in a course, there are some patterns to look for (as we will discuss later in this article). Technology then becomes an enabler for increasing meaningful personal contact. In our observations, we have seen three main technology-enabled strategies for lowering classroom barriers to one-on-one teacher/student (and student/student) interactions: Moving content broadcast out of the classroom: Even in relatively small classes, a lot of class time can be taken up with content broadcast such as lectures and announcements. Personalized learning strategies often try to move as much broadcast out of class time as possible in order to make room for more conversation. This strategy is sometimes called \"flipping\" because it is commonly accomplished by having the teacher record the lectures they would normally give in class and assign the lecture videos as homework, but it can be accomplished in other ways as well, for example with reading-based or problem-based course designs. Turning homework time into contact time: In a traditional class, much of the work that the students do is invisible to the teacher. For some aspects, such as homework problems, teachers can observe the results but are often severely limited by time constraints. In other cases, such as comprehension of assigned readings, the students\\' work is invisible to the teacher and can be observed only indirectly and with significant effort. Personalized learning approaches often allow the teacher to observe the students\\' work in digital products, so that there is more opportunity to coach students. Further, personalized learning often identifies meaningful trends in a student\\'s work and calls the attention of both teacher and student to those trends through analytics. Providing tutoring: Sometimes students get stuck in problem areas that don\\'t require help from a skilled human instructor. Although software isn\\'t good at teaching everything, it can be good at teaching some things. Personalized learning approaches can offload the tutoring for those topics to adaptive learning software that gives students interactive feedback while also turning the students\\' work into contact time by making it observable to the teacher at a glance through analytics. None of these techniques, by themselves, undepersonalize the teaching. They generally need to be designed and implemented by skilled educators as part of a larger course design that is intended to address the particular problems of particular students. In the business world, an analogous initiative might be called \"business process redesign.\" Emphasis is on process. The primary question being asked is, \"What is the most effective way to accomplish the goal?\" The redesigned process may well need software, but it is the process itself that matters. In personalized learning, the process we are redesigning is that of teaching individual students what they need to learn from a class as effectively as possible (though we can easily imagine applying the same kind of exercise to improving advising, course registration, or any other important function). We saw a noteworthy example of this educational design work in action at Essex County College (ECC) in Newark, New Jersey. The majority of ECC students need to take developmental math in order to complete their degrees, and the majority of those do not pass developmental math. Of those who do, the majority do not pass the college-level math course that follows. ECC leadership believed that this educational failure could be attributed to two main factors. First, students came into developmental math with an enormous range of prior knowledge: some had the equivalent of a fourth-grade math education; others needed to learn only a few concepts. Students on one end of the spectrum typically got lost because they were not receiving the individual help they needed, whereas those on the other end often got bored and eventually failed or dropped out because they were being forced to spend a lot of their time on skills that they had already mastered. Second, many ECC students had never been taught good study skills, and faculty did not have the class time needed to teach those skills. So to address the two personalization gaps in this particular course, the college redesigned developmental math using personalized learning techniques. ECC used an overall pedagogical framework called Self-Regulated Learning. Students in the course spend part of their class time in a computer lab, working at their own pace through an adaptive learning math program. Students who already know much of the content can move through it quickly, giving them more time to master the concepts that they have yet to learn. Students who have more to learn can take their time and get tutoring and reinforcement from the software. Teachers, now freed from the task of lecturing, roam the room and give individual attention to those students who need it. They can also see how students are doing, individually and as a class, through the software\\'s analytics. But the course has another critical component that takes place outside the computer lab, separate from the technology. Every week, the teachers meet with the students to discuss learning goals and strategies. Students review the goals they set the previous week, discuss their progress toward those goals, evaluate whether the strategies they used helped them, and develop new goals for the next week. Note the role of the software in this design. In the lab, it primarily takes on the role of tutor, helping most of the students most of the time with routine skill coaching and practice so that the teacher is freed up to give individual attention to those students who really need it. In the goal-setting sessions, the software acts mainly as a record keeper. It helps students track their time on task, number of problems solved, and so on. The teacher then helps students figure out what to do with that information. In both cases, the software is an important enabler of the new teaching practices. But the value that it adds is quite different from the way personalized learning software products are often characterized by sales reps, marketing materials, and many news stories. It is thus worth taking a minor detour from our exploration of personalized learning as a practice to examine the significant gap between the ground truth of the practice and the popular characterizations of the products. Why Such Hype? So far, we have deliberately and explicitly set aside the various policy, political, and business pressures that have brought the term personalized learning into broader use so that we could focus on the educational value that lurks underneath the hype. But it is also important to understand these pressures so that we can be on guard for the ways in which they might deform the discussion and distract us from the real value that we should be talking about. None of the three approaches that we identified above are particularly new; nor do they require fancy algorithms and expensive products to achieve. There are two specific reasons why these approaches are being attached to heavily marketed products right now. First, on the policy side, there has been a shift in emphasis from access to degree completion. President Barack Obama set the tone by announcing a goal that the United States be number one in the world in the proportion of college graduates by 2020. Since then, state and federal policy makers have followed suit. Colleges and universities now have to account for gainful employment metrics and track their institutional scorecard results. Base funding, particularly for public institutions, is increasingly tied to performance against these and similar metrics. Grant funding is also increasingly outcomes-driven. As higher education institutions have narrowed their focus on these metrics, the students who fall through the cracks and fail out of the standard educational model have come into sharper relief. With these policy changes and the funding that follows them, being \"student-centric\" is no longer a nice-to-have goal. Rather, it is a critical success factor for improving measurable student outcomes and therefore getting funding and being seen as a successful institution. For example, whereas in the past a few forward-thinking community college administrators might have thought to take on a project like ECC\\'s personalized learning developmental math redesign out of a sense of mission, now every community college administrator must be looking for ways to improve degree completion by eliminating failure traps such as developmental math. The security of institutional funding depends on it. The second big change has been the widespread commercialization of the adaptive learning techniques that have existed in educational research laboratories for over fifty years.1 As the term adaptive learning suggests, these products provide students with a certain amount of one-on-one tutoring (although the methods that these systems use for analyzing students\\' progress and providing useful feedback vary widely by product and discipline). This change in the market has been enabled by technological advances that are increasingly resulting in one networked computer for every student in a class and affordable developer access to machine learning tools. Market forces are playing a big role in publishing too. Textbook publishers have found that their traditional business model is collapsing as more students find ways to avoid buying new textbooks. Cengage, for example, was forced to go through bankruptcy. McGraw-Hill Education was sold to a private equity firm. Pearson\\'s stock is near historic lows. All of these companies have had multiple rounds of major layoffs. They are in desperate need of a new product, and they are increasingly latching onto the personalized learning trend as the cure for what ails them. Meanwhile, according to Ambient Insight, U.S. ed tech companies received $3.6 billion of angel and venture capital funding in 2015.2 (This doesn\\'t even include mergers and acquisitions, which have also been huge.) Startup founders find themselves in an increasingly crowded field and are under strong pressure to promise and produce big results. Every vendor of a developmental math product, whether that vendor is an established textbook publisher or a young startup, is aware that campus presidents and provosts need to solve their degree-completion problem and that developmental math is very likely to be a big part of that problem. The vendors therefore market their products as a solution to degree completion. Every textbook vendor and aspiring textbook disruptor knows that stories about improving pass rates through technology sell. But what to call these products? Personalized learning is a term that sounds good without the inconvenience of having any obviously specific pedagogical meaning, so it becomes the flag that all vendors fly, even though different products do very different things and even though undepersonalization is rarely accomplished through software alone. Thus, through policy and commercialization, the personalized learning marketing juggernaut was born. Unfortunately, the combination of the marketing shortcuts and the funding pressures created a strong temptation for magical thinking. Campus leaders are being asked to believe that they can solve their degree-completion and other accountability metric problems by buying software that will somehow magically provide personalized learning (in a way that faculty members, by implication, do not). For obvious reasons, faculty are likely to reject this stunted conception of personalized learning. Leaders who want to see their campus communities benefit from personalized learning approaches need to guard against product-centric characterizations and should suggest that discussions of vended solutions take place in the context of course and curricular designs that undepersonalize teaching. Otherwise, the baby will probably get thrown out with the bathwater. Good Candidate Opportunities One of the benefits of reframing personalized learning as undepersonalized teaching and focusing on the three techniques we outlined earlier is that faculty can readily translate this framework into their own contexts and start identifying opportunities that are good candidates for undepersonalization (not all of which will require vended products). In contrast to a product-centric conception of personalized learning, a practice-centered conception is something that faculty can own. That said, we have seen areas of opportunity where personalized learning is often a good fit, and not all of those areas are always obvious. To begin with, any course that students enter with a wide range of prior knowledge and ability is a good candidate. ECC\\'s developmental math is a prototypical example. Another example is Austin Community College\\'s ACCelerator lab, used heavily for developmental math courses.3 But the course doesn\\'t have to be remedial and the institution doesn\\'t have to be access-oriented in order for personalized learning to be helpful. For example, at Middlebury College, a geography professor realized that some students in his course on geographical information systems (GIS) were struggling. For context, this is a general education course that is taken by students in a wide range of majors and specialties. In an elite college like Middlebury, nobody worries too much about completion rates, particularly at the institutional level. The professor simply observed that some students were working very hard. In fact, the course had such a strong reputation for difficulty that taking and passing it was considered a badge of honor. Students were sleeping in the labs. But the professor didn\\'t see this as a sign that he was inspiring his students to work hard. He saw it, rather, as a course-design problem. Some students were working harder than they should because he wasn\\'t reaching them in the way that they needed to be reached. As it turns out, one critical skill that the course was teaching—spatial reasoning—is rarely taught in high school. A handful of the students in the class came in with either prior training or natural talent. They did well. The others were the ones who were sleeping in the labs. They needed more time and more help. The professor decided to make videos of his lectures and assign the videos as homework. With this change, struggling students could watch the videos as often as they needed in the (relative) comfort of their own dorm rooms while the professor\\'s class time was also freed up for more interactive work. (After he had done this, a colleague told the professor that this technique is called \"flipping the classroom\"—a term he had never heard before.) He is also thinking about developing tutorial software that can help students work through the homework problems in ways that best suit their needs. Another obvious opportunity to undepersonalize teaching is in large lecture courses. For example, administrators at the University of California, Davis, became interested in redesigning their survey biology and chemistry courses because they recognized that they were losing a high percentage of first-year students—the ones who typically take these large lecture courses. It is very easy for a student to become passive in this broadcast-heavy course design. The team involved in the course-redesign projects wanted students to both get more individual attention and take more individual responsibility for their learning. To accomplish these goals, the team employed personalized learning practices as a way of making room for more active learning in the classroom. Students used software-based homework to experience much of the content that had previously been delivered in lectures. Faculty redesigned their lecture periods to become interactive discussions. Meanwhile, the teaching assistants who ran the discussion sections used analytics from the homework software to identify the areas where students were struggling; as a result, they could better focus their class time on those areas. Importantly, teaching assistants received additional training in how to employ active learning principles in their teaching techniques. Once again, in contrast to marketing pitches and popular narratives, the software played only a supporting role, albeit an important one, in undepersonalizing the large lecture. A less obvious opportunity for personalized learning is in the design of problem-based learning courses. The previous two examples fit within the common understanding of personalized learning being used to help students work through traditional, didactic courses with more support. But Arizona State University incorporated the \"flipping\" aspect of the technology into an online STEM lab course for non–science majors. In this course students, for their final project, are asked to evaluate the likelihood that there are other intelligent civilizations in a randomly assigned field of stars. The teaching philosophy of the faculty member who was the lead designer of the course is that he should be a coach or a guide, helping students navigate difficult problems. In his view, both content delivery and assessment are activities that take time away from that core function. He and his colleagues framed the course, Habitable Worlds, as a series of challenges. Overcoming each challenge requires the students to learn new knowledge and skills. The course design is based on mastery learning: students must demonstrate that they have learned one skill before moving on to the next. The course is also difficult. Students often get stuck, which is by design. Faculty and teaching assistants, freed up from both content delivery and assignment grading, spend most of their time responding to students\\' questions. And because the coursework is all software-based, they can see exactly what students are doing, how far students have progressed, and where students are struggling. Students can proceed at their own pace, moving quickly where they can and getting help where they need it. Yet despite the self-paced nature of the course, there is also a strong social component. Students can and often do seek out each other\\'s help. Because personalized learning practices make space for more interactivity, these practices often go hand-in-hand with active learning. And active learning is often social. We suspect there are many opportunities in addition to the ones we have identified here. If faculty are given a commonsense framework and a chance to experiment, refine, and share, they will find novel and exciting ways to better support their students\\' individual educational needs. Doing It Right Because personalized learning is a family of educational practices that support good course designs, implementing those practices well is not as simple as buying a product. To begin with, course design is always a time-consuming process when done correctly. Second, in many cases faculty will be trying techniques they have not used before, requiring them to teach in ways that are very different from how they have taught before, that are far removed from their experience (and therefore instincts) of what works and what doesn\\'t, and that may have ripple effects they don\\'t anticipate. On top of all this, the vast majority of faculty are neither trained in course design/research nor compensated for any time they invest in it. They will need time and support. In many cases, implementing personalized learning well can require an institutional effort analogous to the one required to implement an online learning program well. Looking across a range of personalized learning projects that have had varying degrees of success, both at the schools we visited and elsewhere, we can identify six steps for a successful strategy. It should be noted that these themes could be applied to any number of pedagogical innovations. Identify the student need that is to be addressed. The various personalized learning approaches are just one set of tools in the toolbox. Successful programs generally start by identifying a significant educational problem that faculty and program staff believe can be corrected with a change in course design. Design the pedagogical structure. If the problem that is identified can be addressed through personalization, then how will the course support different students differently? The answer has to be more than just \"adaptive learning.\" Successful programs identify opportunities in the course design to improve individual support for students. Pick the products or technologies. The details of different products or technological approaches are most meaningful when they impact what can be done with the course design. Successful programs pick the right tool based on the job at hand rather than on who has the best marketing pitch. Don\\'t forget faculty training. Because personalized learning, done properly, generally means implementing new pedagogical approaches, faculty may need to learn to teach in ways that they haven\\'t taught before. Successful programs provide faculty with training and pedagogical support. Don\\'t forget technology support. Software helps with learning only when it works, and Murphy\\'s Law can hit with a vengeance when technology is mixed with teaching. Successful programs make sure that faculty have the technology training, equipment, and support staff that they need in order to be successful. Be prepared to measure, fail, and iterate. Because personalized learning approaches often require new software, new teaching techniques for faculty, new responsibilities for students, and in some cases new scheduling challenges, institutions will almost inevitably get some things wrong in the first couple of iterations, and those mistakes may have real impact on outcomes. Successful programs approach implementation empirically but with patience. On the bright side, the fact that personalized learning is now being attached to funding-related metrics such as degree-completion rates means that attaching institutional support costs to a funding stream will also be easier. In many cases, schools can build personalized learning \"muscle mass\" by focusing on metric-relevant projects first and then expanding the initiative once the critical institutional knowledge and support mechanisms have been put in place. Final Thoughts: Ed Tech Groundhog Day There is a lesson to be learned here, and it is broader than personalized learning. Every popular ed tech trend, going at least as far back as the original online asynchronous distance learning courses in the 1990s, has brought with it a food fight, with proponents hyping the trend as revolutionary and opponents attacking it as harmful. And in every case, a policy or other institutional driver has resulted in a rush of companies responding to the market opportunity created by that driver. Together, these forces generate hype and magical thinking, which in turn provoke an equal and opposite reaction. In this article, we have tried to identify specific teaching practices being used by educators, and we have tried to describe them in commonsense terms that should make intuitive sense to experienced teachers. These practices always exist at the beginning. Some teacher somewhere comes up with a specific approach to a specific problem. External forces then make that problem a more institutionally consequential one, and companies rush in to name, market, and sell solutions. In the process, we lose track of the original educational idea. It\\'s like playing a game of telephone in a noisy airport. Except in this case, the message in the game is an actual plan for how we are going to help our students, and when it gets to the end of the telephone line, we will act as if we received the message with perfect fidelity. And then fight over it. Endlessly. Much of the Gartner hype cycle can be attributed to this process.4 We can break out of this hype cycle with a fairly simple (though not necessarily easy) approach. Whenever a new ed tech trend gets named—whether it is distance learning, adaptive learning, personalized learning, competency-based education, MOOCs, or something else—we should start trying to understand that trend by looking for the best examples of what teachers and students are doing when they are doing the thing we just named. We should ask them what they are doing, and why. We should ask how their practice is working and what they are learning and what they don\\'t yet know. We should attach the name of the new trend to those educational practices and those reasons—rather than to any products, technologies, or services. We should not waste time debating whether the name we came up with for those practices is the perfect name or exactly what it includes or excludes. Instead, we should spend our time trying to understand the practices themselves and their applicability to the educational problems we are trying to solve. Yes, personalized learning is a lousy term, but it is attached to legitimate educational practices that have the potential to improve the lives of many students. It is also a term that is trapped in the early stages of its hype cycle. So let\\'s just skip to the end and break personalized learning out of the hype cycle by doing our best to understand—and explain—what it really is and why it really matters.

Traditional Learning: A Detailed Overview Of The Two Approaches Billion Photos/Shutterstock.com Level 7 By Aman Kumar Singh September 12, 2023 6 minutes to read +2 Comments Summary: In this article, we are going to review two different educational approaches: blended learning and traditional learning. Read on. Exploring Two Different Approaches Of Learning In the ever-evolving landscape of education, the battle between blended learning and traditional learning approaches continues to rage on. These two educational paradigms represent distinct methodologies, each with its own set of advantages and disadvantages. As the digital age progresses, the conversation about which is superior intensifies, leaving educators and learners pondering which path to choose. In this comprehensive exploration, we will dissect the concepts of blended learning and traditional learning, weighing their merits, and attempting to discern the most effective route to academic success. Blended Learning: A Fusion Of Old And New Blended learning, also known as hybrid learning, represents a seamless integration of traditional, face-to-face classroom instruction with digital, online learning. It is a pedagogical approach that aims to combine the best of both worlds. Key characteristics of blended learning include: Online and in-person elements Blended learning employs a combination of face-to-face classroom sessions and online activities. This blend offers students a diverse learning experience that spans physical interactions and digital engagement. Flexibility in scheduling Unlike the rigid schedules of traditional learning, blended learning provides students with more autonomy over their learning pace. They can access online resources and assignments at their convenience, allowing for a personalized learning journey. Student-centered approach Blended learning encourages students to take an active role in their education. Online components often involve self-directed assignments, fostering independence and responsibility in learners. Diverse learning resources Students enrolled in blended learning programs have access to a wide range of resources, including digital materials, multimedia content, and interactive online platforms. This diversity caters to various learning styles and preferences. Personalization Blended learning enables instructors to tailor their teaching approaches to the specific needs of individual students. Learners can progress through material at their own speed and revisit concepts as necessary. Traditional Learning: The Time-Tested Approach Traditional learning, often referred to as in-person or face-to-face learning, is the age-old method of education that has stood the test of time. In this model, students physically attend classrooms, engage directly with teachers, and interact with peers. The key attributes of traditional learning include: In-person interaction Traditional learning is characterized by direct, real-time interaction between students and educators. This immediacy facilitates instant feedback, clarifications, and the creation of a dynamic learning atmosphere. Structured scheduling Traditional learning adheres to a predetermined schedule, with fixed class times and durations. Students are required to attend classes at specific hours. Teacher-centric In a traditional classroom, the instructor plays a central role in content delivery, explanation of concepts, and the facilitation of discussions. Limited flexibility Students enrolled in traditional programs often have limited flexibility in terms of their learning pace. They must adhere to the class schedule, which may not cater to individual learning needs. Limited resources Learning materials are typically provided in the classroom, with additional resources limited to textbooks and physical materials available in the school or library. The Advantages And Disadvantages Of Blended Learning Advantages Of Blended Learning Flexibility Blended learning allows students to learn at their own pace, making it suitable for various learning styles and individual needs. Enhanced engagement The inclusion of online resources and interactive activities often results in higher student engagement and participation. Accessibility Online components make education more accessible to remote or busy learners who may struggle with the constraints of traditional learning. Personalization Blended learning enables instructors to personalize learning experiences, addressing individual needs more effectively. Disadvantages Of Blended Learning Technical challenges Access to technology and reliable internet is necessary for blended learning, which can be a barrier for some students. Self-discipline Blended learning demands strong self-motivation and time management skills, which not all students possess. Reduced face-to-face interaction Some students may miss the direct, in-person interaction with teachers and peers that traditional learning provides. The Advantages And Disadvantages Of Traditional Learning Advantages Of Traditional Learning Direct interaction In-person interactions facilitate immediate clarification of doubts and questions, creating a dynamic learning environment. Classroom environment Some students thrive in a structured, physical classroom setting, finding it conducive to focused learning. Social interaction Traditional learning environments foster peer collaboration and networking opportunities, which can be valuable for building relationships and professional networks. Disadvantages Of Traditional Learning Limited flexibility Fixed schedules in traditional learning may not accommodate the diverse needs of students, including those with work or family commitments. Limited resources Traditional learning might lack the variety of resources available in online environments, potentially limiting the depth and breadth of learning. Accessibility Geographical constraints can limit access to quality education, particularly in remote or underserved areas. Finding The Right Balance The choice between blended learning and traditional learning is not a one-size-fits-all decision. It hinges on a myriad of factors, including educational goals, student preferences, instructor capabilities, and available resources. Many educational institutions recognize the potential benefits of blended learning models that integrate the strengths of both approaches. By combining the richness of face-to-face interactions with the flexibility and accessibility of online resources, educators aim to provide a versatile and effective learning experience that caters to a diverse student body. Blended Learning In Practice: Success Stories To better understand the real-world impact of blended learning, let's explore some success stories from educational institutions that have embraced this approach. Khan Academy Khan Academy is a renowned online learning platform that effectively uses blended learning principles. Students can access a wealth of instructional videos and exercises at their own pace, while teachers can monitor their progress and provide personalized support in the classroom. This blended learning model has empowered students to take control of their learning and has resulted in improved academic outcomes. Rocketship Education Rocketship Education, a network of charter schools, combines online and in-person instruction to tailor learning experiences for each student. By leveraging technology for core instruction and reserving in-person time for enrichment and support, they have achieved remarkable results, particularly in underserved communities. Flipped classrooms The flipped classroom model is a popular form of blended learning. In this approach, students watch video lectures or engage with online materials at home, freeing up classroom time for interactive discussions and hands-on activities. This methodology has proven successful in enhancing student understanding and engagement. Traditional Learning In Practice: Time-Tested Wisdom Traditional learning continues to thrive in various educational settings, especially when certain elements of face-to-face instruction are indispensable. Let's look at some instances where the traditional approach remains invaluable: Medical education In the field of medicine, hands-on training and direct interaction with instructors are vital. Medical schools often rely heavily on traditional learning methods to ensure that students acquire the necessary skills and expertise. Performing arts Performing arts education, such as music, dance, and theater, heavily relies on face-to-face instruction. The physical presence of instructors and the collaborative nature of these disciplines make traditional learning essential. Early childhood education Young children often benefit from the social and emotional development that occurs in traditional classroom settings.

The teacher:Has full control over the learning environment. Decides the teaching methodology. Determines the course curriculum.In the traditional method of teaching, teachers followed the drill and rote method of memorization. In this method, children learn through repetition and memorization. There is little or no scope for critical thinking. Related Blog: Remedial Teaching Strategies and Tips: Enhance Student LearningNowadays, with online courses gaining popularity, this method definitely sounds outdated. But in educational institutions, it is still the accepted model. But it is important to note that, today, the traditional method of learning has adopted a new form. The classroom set-up remains the same, but there is more space for experimentation. Teachers are still the head of the classroom because they accommodate the needs of students to create an effective teaching model. Teachers deliver lectures, but presentations and seminars are part of the course curriculum. So, today, we have the traditional method of teaching at the core of our education system. But there is a mix of certain modern elements to keep it in sync with the changing times.Also read: E-learning Vs traditional learning: Which one is better?Features of traditional learningTo better understand what the traditional method of teaching involves, let’s have a look at some of its key features.

While one cannot ignore the drawbacks of the traditional model, its advantages are equally felt. So, for a better understanding, let’s have a look at some advantages of traditional learning. The traditional method of teaching has immense scope for active learning. Students learn through personal interactions with their fellow students. This creates an active learning environment and helps them develop their communication skills.Traditional learning develops the student’s mind and their social self. They build interpersonal relationships with their teachers and other students of their age group and, with them, learn the ways of the world. In the traditional learning method, there is space for practical aspects of learning. For instance, chemistry, or biology experiments best happen within a traditional laboratory. Also, school playgrounds are best suited to enhance the mobility of children in a safe set-up. I want to teach onlineGOT YOUR CONTENT READY? GRAPHY IS ALL YOU NEED TO GET STARTED!As traditional learning happens on-campus, students have access to libraries, canteens, and other facilities.With this method, the question of the digital divide never surfaces. The traditional teaching method aims to teach students the importance of time management. There is a proper timetable that students and teachers need to follow. This method is best for hands-on training as it establishes direct contact between teachers and students.

Education came to a standstill during the consecutive lockdowns because face-to-face interaction became an impossibility. It introduced us to the importance of online teaching, and since then, online lessons have grown in significance. So, if you are an educator who wishes to make use of this online wave, build and market your online course with us at Graphy. I want to teach onlineGOT YOUR CONTENT READY? GRAPHY IS ALL YOU NEED TO GET STARTED!But before that, let’s have a look at some other disadvantages of traditional learning. As traditional learning is time and location-bound, there is no flexibility. Traditional learning is not adaptive to the needs of children. The teacher-centric approach prioritizes the preferences of the teachers over the needs of each student. The teacher follows the methodology that they think is best for students and seldom leaves any space for improvisation. Traditional teaching is quite expensive as compared to online teaching. It involves infrastructure and maintenance costs.While a traditional classroom set-up offers a lot of space for practical learning, the focus is mostly on theory-based lessons. The strict schedule doesn’t leave much time for practical learning. In the traditional method of teaching, the daily commute becomes a big disadvantage. This might place a financial burden on students or even obstruct the effective learning process.

Teaching is conducted synchronously in a physical learning environment (utilizing appropriate safety measures), meaning that “traditionally,” the students are in the same place simultaneously. The traditional classroom has the significant advantage of face-to-face interaction between the student and educator and the students themselves. Students derive motivation from the teacher as well as from the other students. Learning Environment In a traditional lecture-style class, information is sometimes fed to the student and then passed back to the instructor through written proctored assessments. Students have found that the face-to-face classroom can be an active learning environment at Iowa State University using effective lecturing practices. The learning space is also physical (utilizing appropriate safety measures). Both student and instructor can see, hear, and pick up on physical cues and body language. Reading Requirements Students typically have regular reading assignments from the textbook and other resources provided or referred to by the instructor to supplement material covered in-person. Course Pace Class meetings occur at a specific time in one particular physical location (utilizing appropriate safety measures) according to a set schedule. When in class, the instructor typically sets the pace. Discussions When a discussion takes place in the physical learning environment, the instructor often leads and facilitates the conversation’s focus to conclude within a limited amount of time. Since time is limited, responses typically must be formulated quickly. Speaking live in a learning space has the benefit of visual cues of fellow students and the instructor. Exams and Quizzes (Assessments) Delivery of exams, quizzes, and critiques are typically in the physical learning space during regularly scheduled class time. The monitoring of students takes place during the exam period, limiting the length of the meeting period. A review of the assessment typically takes place during a class meeting. Assignments Submission of homework assignments, research papers, labs, studio work, etc. to the instructor may occur in-person and in hard copy form in the traditional in-person classroom. Submitting assignments may also take place online, given the dramatic increase in the number of face-to-face courses that utilize online technologies in specific face-to-face courses. A review of the graded assignment often takes place within the physical learning space. Group work Since students are in the same place simultaneously, an in-person course (utilizing appropriate safety measures) lends itself nicely to group work, labs, studios, and team-based learning. The use of class time can provide for this collaboration, and progress may be continued among the students after the class is over through scheduled meetings (online or offline).

considering college, prospective students have many choices. They can enroll in a traditional four-year college program, speed up their college studies with a two-year associate’s degree or they can choose an online degree. Online classes can be beneficial and sometimes less expensive than other college options, but there are some things that students will miss out on without traditional campus learning. In this article, we will explore the numerous advantages of traditional education or traditional learning. Importance of Traditional Education Before online learning got in the game, on-campus learning was the only efficient learning format. Multiple benefits students typically gain from traditional campus learning aren’t limited to study only. While on campus, students get to hone their social skills while interacting with both their teachers and colleagues. It creates a routine that the students have to follow, and in turn, this will bring punctuality and discipline. Advantages of Traditional Classroom Learning As online learning has become more and more popular in the internet era, traditional classroom learning continues to be a tough contender. Despite its advantages, online learning cannot replace traditional education. Its many perks will make sure of it. Active learning One of the top reasons that traditional campus life can benefit a student’s college life is having contact with professors and instructors. With online learning, the options are limited. On-campus, students can set up face-to-face meetings with their professors to discuss the class, their performance, or a project. Maintaining interpersonal relationships Students are involved with different people throughout their college experience. One benefit of being enrolled in an on-campus university is creating meaningful relationships that will probably last for years. The college experience is entirely about having to be part of many individual and group projects which require you to communicate with your colleagues. Different clubs that are created in the university, gatherings to study for exams and the sharing of the study notes are some of the ways through which one can maintain interpersonal relationships. While retaining those relationships on campus is quite easy, doing so online will surely be a problem. Not all majors can be taught online If a student is considering a major in nursing, agriculture, biology, music, or theater, online programs can only get them so far. While it is easy to take some required classes online in these majors, the classes that include labs, clinical practice, or performances cannot be done without a traditional campus class. Having a traditional campus learning environment for these majors will provide access to equipment and materials they would normally not have access to with an online class. Access to libraries and research materials A university’s campus library is always a busy place for students to study, collaborate, and do research for papers and projects. Without easy access to research materials held by the university and everything that the library has to offer, a student cannot always reach their full potential with in-depth study in a particular field. Learning is scheduled University officials organize the courses in a way that all the students can attend them. Attending classes means joining the class on time. In this way, students will get a routine of their own, which will inevitably make the students punctual and disciplined. As they practice being punctual throughout the academic years, they’ll build those habits and carry them into adulthood. Extra-curricular activities There are some school experiences you won’t gain in any other place. Field trips, school activities, and different clubs, part of which you can be are just some of those experiences. From each of those activities, you’ll take life lessons that will be beneficial in your future. Disadvantages of Online Learning We can easily say that the aspects that aren’t the strongest suit of online learning format are definitely of traditional classroom learning. Lack of face-to-face interaction While in the beginning, some may see the lack of one-on-one interaction with teachers and colleagues as an advantage, this may turn out to be not the advantage expected. In the long-term, you’ll see that it will take way more effort to interact with the teachers and colleagues online. Even though the contact through emails and social media might make the communication easier for both parties, you’ll never have the connection and intimacy live communication has. Not all majors are available While you can study many different subjects online, some of them can’t be adjusted to the online format. All those majors that require hands-on training or use of any equipment fall in this category. To study these particular majors, you may have to attend their classes on campus. Increased responsibility Sure, flexibility is what makes online learning unique and convenient for students. However, this flexibility can be a double-edged sword. While you can attend the classes at your own pace, it’s your responsibility to organize everything else in between and to manage your time efficiently. No one will remember you to log in to the online classroom, join message boards, and finish the assignments on time. You need to be motivated and disciplined enough to finish your online program.

Lack of accreditation While many universities in the world, even ivy league ones among them are more and more joining the online format classroom, the risk of enrolling in an online university that might not be certified by state agencies is still present. For you not to become a victim of these kinds of universities, you should do thorough research on the chosen university beforehand. Networking challenges Online students might miss a lot of opportunities on-campus students may take for granted. On the university grounds, you will meet people who share the same passion for the field you’re studying, get to be part of many conferences where guest speakers are invited, or introduce yourself to teachers of different fields. Those meetings, no matter how short in time, will yield many job offers. Although online learning might have many benefits, this isn’t one of them.

Online Learning Jacob Lund/Shutterstock.com By Barindra De February 4, 2018 3 minutes to read Comments Summary: The article talks about the differences between classroom/traditional learning vs. online learning. Even today there is a vast number of people who are hesitant to try out unconventional learning methods. In this article, we try to investigate the differences between the two. Traditional Learning Vs. Online Learning: Differences, Advantages, And Disadvantages These days online courses/training have become extremely popular, as more and more institutes and companies are offering courses online. However, despite the popularity of online education, vast groups of people consciously stay away from such methods, mostly due to misconception. At the same time, despite the rising popularity of online courses, traditional (classroom) training is fighting back and trying to adopt newer means of retaining learners' interest. There are always two sides of a coin. For some individuals, online training is more appropriate, while for others classroom training is the preferred delivery method. Let us compare the two methods. Online Learning People take professional level courses usually to increase their qualifications and enhance their career opportunities in their jobs. For example, to get promotion in higher level and higher paid jobs; in management related professional degrees, diplomas are helpful. However many employees may be exhausted after their work and don’t want to attend regular classes. So, naturally, an online class is more convenient for them, as it saves valuable time, money, and energy. The best thing about online learning is that individuals can take a course from the comfort of their office or home. Even with a busy schedule, one can find some spare time to take a course or study for it. In online classes, the learner is not directly interacting with the faculty. So in case of having any questions, they may find it difficult to ask their online instructor, as communication is often very impersonal. However, these courses often offer alternatives to live query resolution like online forums, emails, and chatrooms. Using these alternatives can be helpful for individuals to get their queries answered. People often think that interacting with a trainer live is the best way to learn, as it is interactive and allows for two-way communication. For such types of people, synchronous online courses will be more appropriate. Another way to acquire knowledge through an online medium is by searching on different search engines like Google, Bing, etc. Although this helps by reducing the amount of books one has to read, there may be too many sources of information one has to read, and choose the relevant ones, which can result in information overload. Thus online learning may be more suitable for grownups who are continuing their education while they're working in their regular jobs. Traditional Learning Traditional classes are more suitable for young children, teenagers, and young adolescents who are yet to join the workforce. Regular attendance in classes helps them interact with other individuals of their own age, be better disciplined, follow a regular schedule, and improve their physical fitness and mental alertness. Classroom learning helps students and teachers know each other in a better manner. This allows teachers to know the students and evaluate their strengths and weaknesses better, act as mentors, and guide students in their career possibilities. In a traditional classroom, students can directly share their views and clarify their own queries with the teacher, thus getting their questions answered right away. Most of the time books and classroom notes are very useful for studying and passing exams. Understanding the Question & Answer pattern, and with suggestions provided by experienced teachers, students can find it more helpful to learn than when using generalized online notes and suggestions available on the internet. Also, classroom learning is more helpful due to a continuous interaction between students and teachers, as it helps students to get rid of their fears regarding exams, which can rarely happen with online guidance. Lastly, interactions with good teachers help motivate students to achieve higher marks. Read Also eLearning Or Traditional Classroom Learning? Exploring The Pros And Cons Blended Learning Vs.

The debate between online learning versus traditional education grows each year. The Corona crisis made it even more relevant, as employees in many countries were forced to work from home. So, suddenly all the learning activities had to take place online. But is it a good substitute for traditional learning? Let’s have a look at the differences, similarities, and conclude who the winner is! Written by Carolinehttps://www.easy-lms.com/index.php?r=content%2Fcontent%2Fabout-us%2Fwho-we-are Content Manager & HR Officer Posted on July 22, 2020 Updated on November 13, 2023 Reading time 5 minutes Table of contents What is online learning? What is traditional learning? What are the differences between online and traditional learning? Are there any similarities? And the winner is …? What is online learning? Online learning is exactly what it sounds like: it takes place over the internet. It is a form of distance learning. It’s interchangeable with the term e-learning. An LMS typically stores the training content, which is accessible anywhere and anytime. What is traditional learning? Traditional learning takes place in a classroom setting Traditional learning takes place in a classroom setting. There is a trainer who moderates and regulates the flow of information and knowledge. Then, the trainer expects the employees to deepen their knowledge through written exercises at home. Nowadays, technology is incorporated in the classroom more and more. However, in face-to-face instruction scenarios, the primary source of information is still the trainer. What are the differences between online and traditional learning? If you are deciding between online or traditional learning, it can be helpful to consider the below comparison: Online education Traditional education It happens online It happens offline Anytime, anyplace Forced in a schedule and place Flexible pace Imposed pace Alone Together with your colleagues Supports an independent learning style Learning from and with each other The primary source of information is online content The primary source of information is the trainer Limited interaction Extensive interaction between trainers and colleagues These are the obvious differences, but there are also differences in terms of costs and participation rates. Let’s expand a bit on these points: Participation rates Although high priority may be given to continuous education in organizations, many times, it is not fully implemented. Employees who take part in the training set up by their managers can feel rushed. Why? Because time is limited, especially given our to-do list that grows each day. Online learning then comes to the rescue. In fact, a survey [1] of over 700 corporate learners, found out that 87 percent of them preferred to take online courses during work hours. It takes less time than face-to-face learning, and they can easily squeeze it into their daily tasks. Online modules are often more affordable than in in-house training Costs Setting up traditional training is valuable, but also expensive. Online modules are often more affordable than in in-house training. Why? You don’t have to deal with additional costs like travel expenses, training facilities, hiring a trainer, or printing training materials that come with in-house training. In 2019, U.S. training expenses amounted to $83 billion! Of this, 29.6 billion was spent on these additional costs. The overhead to operate online training programs is much lower. The economic argument shouldn’t be de only decisive factor in whether you choose online training over traditional training for your company. Read more about the other compelling advantages and disadvantages of online learning. Are there any similarities? Although there are more differences than similarities between face-to-face and online learning, what they have in common is that they are both effective. Effectiveness Online learning is a full-fledged alternative for classroom training We can’t say that online learning is more effective than traditional education, or vice versa. It certainly depends on the learning topic and how its effectiveness has been measured. But overall, it seems that online learning is a full-fledged alternative for classroom training. There is good and ample evidence that employees generally learn as much as online as they do in traditional training. And the winner is …? We would love to call a winner, but we can’t. It wouldn’t be fair to either of the learning methods because both have their pros and cons. Which learning method is right for your employees or organization depends on many factors: What’s your budget? What’s the learning topic? Is it practical-based or knowledge-driven? What do you want to achieve with the learning? Improving skills or keeping your employees up-to-date about company standards? How much time do you want to spend on training as an organization? And how much time can employees spend on training? What’s your employees’ motivation level? Do you have employees of various ages? Do you primarily work with millennials, or is the majority of your workforce from the baby boomer generation? Maybe choosing one over the other is too rigid. If you want to combine the best of both worlds, then you should certainly consider blended learning. What we do know is that we can offer you a complete LMS to set up continuous training in your organization. With Easy LMS, you can create and manage effective training courses, check their knowledge with exams, and generate custom certificates.

Exploring The Evolving Landscape Of Digital Education Online learning, also known as distance education or eLearning, refers to the delivery of educational content and instruction through the internet. It allows students to take courses and earn degrees remotely, without the need to be physically present on campus. Online learning can take many different forms, such as web-based courses, video conferencing, and self-paced learning programs. It is becoming an increasingly popular way for students to access education, as it offers flexibility and convenience. Advantages And Disadvantages Of Online Learning There are both advantages and disadvantages to online learning. Some of the main advantages include: Flexibility Online courses allow students to learn at their own pace and schedule, as they can access course materials and complete assignments whenever it is convenient for them. Cost Online courses are often less expensive than traditional in-person courses, as there are no transportation or relocation costs. Access to a wider range of courses Students who live in rural areas or who have busy schedules may have limited access to certain courses or programs. Online learning allows students to take courses from anywhere in the world. Self-paced learning Online courses allow students to work at their own pace and spend as much time as they need on each lesson. Some of the main disadvantages of online learning include: Lack of face-to-face interaction Online courses do not offer the same level of interaction and support as in-person courses. Technical difficulties There is a risk of technical issues such as internet outages or computer problems that can disrupt learning. Limited access to resources In-person courses often have access to resources such as laboratories or studios that may not be available to online students. Self-motivation Online courses require a high level of self-motivation, as there is no instructor present to provide structure and support. How Is Online Learning Helpful For Kids? Online learning can be helpful for kids in a number of ways: 1. Flexibility Online learning allows kids to learn at their own pace and schedule, which can be especially helpful for those with busy schedules or who need to accommodate other commitments. 2. Access To A Range Of Courses Online learning allows kids to take courses that may not be offered at their school or in their local area. 3. Self-Paced Learning Online courses can be tailored to the individual needs and learning style of each child, allowing them to work at their own pace and spend as much time as they need on each lesson. 4. Improved Critical Thinking And Problem-Solving Skills Online learning can encourage kids to be more independent and self-directed learners, as they are responsible for managing their own learning and seeking out additional resources as needed. 5. Technology Skills Online learning can help kids develop important technology skills such as navigating online platforms, using communication tools, and completing assignments electronically. How Is Online Learning Not Helpful? There are a few ways in which online learning may not be helpful for some students: 1. Lack Of Face-To-Face Interaction Online courses do not offer the same level of interaction and support as in-person courses, which can be challenging for some students who prefer a more traditional classroom setting. 2. Technical Difficulties There is a risk of technical issues such as internet outages or computer problems that can disrupt learning and make it difficult for students to complete assignments. 3. Limited Access To Resources In-person courses often have access to resources, such as laboratories or studios, that may not be available to online students. 4. Self-Motivation Online courses require a high level of self-motivation, as there is no instructor present to provide structure and support. This can be challenging for students who need more support and guidance. 5. Limited Access To Certain Programs Some programs, such as those in the arts or hands-on fields, may not be fully available online. This can limit access for students who are interested in these areas of study. Conclusion In conclusion, online learning can be a helpful and convenient option for kids, offering flexibility, access to a wider range of courses, and the opportunity to develop important technology skills. However, it is not the right choice for every child, as it may lack the face-to-face interaction and support that some students need to thrive. It is important for parents to consider their child's individual learning style and needs when deciding if online learning is a good fit.

Some online learning programs may require you to order physical textbooks in advance by in the mail, but these are generally being phased out in favor of eBooks and online-only methods of delivery. For those institutions that have made the transition to using 100% online resources, students can expect to study using a combination of cutting-edge technological resources with no need to travel to attend lectures, exams or in-person discussion sessions!Taking an online learning program, you\\'ll be an officially registered student at your institution and have access to the same resources as an on-campus student, like your institution\\'s digital library, learning management system (like Blackboard), student union membership and more! An online degree is similar to taking a degree program on campus, but you have the freedom to direct your own study schedule. Your school and your course instructor will determine the format for each individual course and will select delivery methods that are best suited to your course or program. What a Biology major needs to learn successfully online will differ from what an Art History major needs! Online learning may be a completely new experience for you. If you\\'re coming from a more traditional learning background, read on to discover how to make the most of the resources you may encounter in your online learning journey! eBooks, textbooks & journalsThese written materials are essential resources in almost every course you\\'ll take when learning online.Using the reading list for each course, or on the advice of your course instructor, you\\'ll need to dedicate the amount of time you need to reading and understanding the topics in the literature. The main advantage of using this medium (particularly eBooks) is the fact that they are completely portable, allowing you to study on the go from your computer, phone or tablet. Pro tip:When you’re researching a course or program, remember to check whether your textbooks are included in your tuition fees! You may have to pay extra for your textbooks, or they may be available as eBooks from your institution\\'s library. Recorded lecturesAn essential way of absorbing a large amount of information in a relatively short amount of time, lectures are a staple of online and campus-based learning. With online learning, you can attend lectures from your bedroom! Pro tip:If you can, make notes throughout your lectures; this will make it easier to review for exams, and any assignments you\\'ll need to complete throughout your course. Interactive sessionsThe greatest challenge an online education provider faces is how to replicate the face-to-face interaction and in-person discussions that on-campus institutions can easily provide.The solution? Online degree programs often use a combination of discussion forums and interactive question-and-answer sessions to give you the interaction with other students and instructors you need. Pro tip:Before beginning an online discussion forum or interactive session, make sure you read the rules and requirements; some institutions may require you to create posts that have a minimum word count.\"For institutions using 100% online resources, students can expect to study using a combination of cutting-edge technological resources with no need to travel to attend lectures, exams or in-person discussion sessions.\"How Will Online Learning Be Delivered? Online students often think that their learning resources will be delivered via email, or even by snail mail! Most online institutions are moving away from this unreliable method of delivery.The course or module’s learning resources will be delivered via the institution’s online learning environment or platform. The learning platform will vary depending on the software used, but it will usually consist of a central online platform that students can access from their personal PC, mobile or tablet.One of the major benefits of utilizing resources that are hosted entirely online is unending flexibility!As an online student, you can choose to access your course information and complete your assignments at any time. This allows you to fit study time in around your work, family and other commitments. This also means that students who wish to continue working while studying do not have to put their careers on hold. Get the best of both worlds! How is Online Learning Assessed?Students taking a degree program or an individual course online will still be tested at regular intervals throughout their study period to assess their understanding of the course materials.For those new to online education, this process can be intimidating. But there\\'s no need to worry! Online institutions are experienced professionals, they\\'ll ensure that your assessments are fair, comfortable, and designed to help you make the most of your learning experience. Discover the assessment types you\\'re likely to encounter when taking an online degree program or course: Individual AssignmentsThese are probably the method of assessment that students will have the most experience with. For each assignment, you’ll receive your topic, deadline and word count. You\\'ll be required to produce a structured, reasoned argument within the boundaries set out by your course instructor. Discussion activitiesFace-to-face discussions between friends and colleagues is something that we all do every day. However, an online academic discussion requires a different set of skills, and might not come as naturally when your first start your online learning journey. Not to worry, you\\'ll get the hang of it!These activities will differ depending on the institution, but your course instructor will generally start each discussion off with a question or topic for debate. Students then need to research the topic and post their responses to the task demonstrating their own knowledge and understanding. Often, you\\'ll end up in a debate with the ideas and views posted by fellow students. Journal activitiesLike discussion boards, journal activities tend to be specific to online courses. A journal entry is an ongoing update giving you the opportunity to reflect back on what you\\'ve learned during the period under review, and how you\\'ll apply what you\\'ve learned in the future. Online learning doesn\\'t take place in classrooms, and journal entries are straightforward ways for course instructors to get a grasp of how you\\'re progressing through the course and if you\\'re gaining knowledge in the right areas. Unlike other assignments, it is acceptable to use a subjective, personal style of writing in journal entries and refer to yourself in the first person. Think, \"Over the last week, I\\'ve learned how to ...\" Journal entries are often required, but ungraded - be genuine! ExamsAlthough they can be nerve-wracking, exams are a key way to test your learning.Institutions may choose to allow students to complete their exams on their own personal computer, in a location of their choosing. Because tutors have no way to oversee a virtual exam or test, they are typically open-book and open-note. As a viable alternative, many institutions will offer the option of completing \\'take-home\\' examinations in the form of an essay or final assignment. Some institutions may use exam software like virtual proctors, or tools to monitor if you visit new web pages. How Do Online Institutions Prevent Cheating?Misinformation abounds that online students can simply cheat their way to success by purchasing assignments or using revision materials during virtual examinations. This couldn’t be further from the truth. Online learning doesn\\'t mean easier learning! Online institutions should adhere to the same standards of excellence as brick-and-mortar institutions. As online learning technology has developed, virtual institutions have perfected digital processes to prevent cheating and/or plagiarism. Course instructors and online institutions work hard to ensure that cheating is almost impossible in an online course. By making use of advanced plagiarism detection software, all submissions you make for your online course, from examinations to assignments are scrutinized electronically using anti-plagiarism software, and then will also be subject to additional checks by your instructor.\"Course instructors and institutions work hard to ensure that cheating is almost impossible on an online course.\"Recognition of Online QualificationsMany online institutions are fully accredited institutes of higher learning. Your institution will clearly state the type of qualification you\\'ll gain from pursuing an online program with them - from bachelor to master degrees, graduate certificates, and everything in-between. Use online learning to gain the qualifications you need! Despite this, students researching online institutions are still encouraged to research their accreditation, the type of qualification you\\'ll earn from an online learning program, and the nature of the online institution itself.The rules for accreditation and the types of qualifications an online institution is permitted to give students can vary depending on a number of factors, including:The country the online institution is based in; If the institution is public or private; The institution\\'s official title - university, school, academy etc.; andThe type of program the institution is offering - degree, certificate, qualification. Students use online learning to studying entire degree programs, get particular certifications to take the next step in their careers, or to pursue a practical qualification available online.No matter why you\\'re looking to learn online, ensure that you have a full understanding of the type of institution you\\'ll be studying at, and how the qualifications they offer will be recognized in your country or by future employers before signing up!Many online institutions will partner with campus-based universities to create and deliver their online programs. This enables an online institution to benefit from the specialized knowledge and technology that an online provider can offer, while the online institution is then able to offer validated degree courses through the brick-and-mortar institution. \"Students considering online study should not be deterred by old-fashioned ideas about ‘real’ degrees only being awarded by campus-based institutions.\"Online Learning and Employment Once you have an in-depth understanding of how your qualifications earned online are recognized in your country, you\\'ll be able to plan how you\\'ll talk about your online learning experience to employers!Many employers make no differentiation between online degrees and degrees earned on campus - as long as your qualifications are recognized in your field. For some employers, gaining your qualifications online will provide you with a unique skill set to help you stand out from the crowd of other applicants. Students considering online study should not be deterred by old-fashioned ideas about ‘real’ degrees only being awarded by campus-based institutions. In fact, many employers now recognize that studying online (and part-time) takes a large amount of dedication and commitment. The passion and drive needed to achieve your qualifications online are characteristics of many star employees across industries.Think studying for an online degree is something uncommon? Think again; the latest statistics show that around 33% of college students are taking at least one course online and “eventually, one-third of college students expect to study online, one-third expect to study only on campus, and one-third will do both.” This increased participation will naturally lead to increased recognition of online learning. Furthermore, there is a 71% expected increase in online enrolments overall.Support for Online LearningAn important aspect that determines the quality of a study experience is the level of support that students receive. Many students worry that online institutions will not be able to provide the support that they need. This concern is increasingly being recognized by online learning providers, and many are working hard to ensure that students’ needs are met in all areas.The main concern that potential students have regarding support is the lack of face-to-face help that an online course provides; however, by using technology like video calling and the more traditional phone and email, virtual institutions are increasingly bridging the gap between online and on-campus student support.Student Support TeamsA dedicated Student Support team often forms the core of online institutions\\' student support functions. The sole responsibility of this team is to provide pastoral care and support. Online (and part-time) students can experience problems and issues that are unique to this mode of study, and online learning institutions\\' Student Support teams will be experienced and sympathetic to the range of issues experienced by online learners.Student Support teams are often trained in providing advice on issues from financial troubles to family commitments, and can range from minor technology troubleshooting to major life events like a bereavement. This isn’t the only support you receive on an online course; your fellow students are also a great source of help and advice. Using online discussion forums provided by the institution, WhatsApp and even Facebook groups, students can create an online community that supports each classmate as they overcome obstacles together as a group.In-House & Freelance InstructorsThe role that personal and pastoral support plays in an online student’s success cannot be overstated. However, academic support also plays a vital role in creating a supportive learning environment.Online institutions vary, but many utilize a combination of in-house and freelance course instructors to create and deliver their courses. These instructors will be qualified subject experts and will be able to give academic guidance and feedback at any point in the course.Academic feedback can sometimes be tough to receive, particularly if you’ve put a great deal of effort into a piece, but this can often be the first step towards improvement and greater confidence. Your instructors will always provide constructive commentary, giving tips and advice for the future, and this can then lead to improved confidence in decision-making and broader subject-specific understanding.Depending on the institution, your instructor should also be available for individual sessions, and you should also be able to contact your instructor directly. Individual sessions with your instructor will enable you to ask questions about topics covered within the course, and request further feedback on your progress and areas of development.Pro tip:During your course research, make sure you’ll receive the academic support you’ll need; check the office hours and availability of your instructors, the turnaround time for receiving your grades and the qualifications of the course leaders.Popular Online Universities EU Business school onlineCourses available in: Business Administration (both BBA and MBA), Master in Innovation & Entrepreneurship, Master in Fashion and Luxury Business Browse their online degreesIUBH Online Courses available in: Bachelor Data Science, Masters of Business Administration, Master Computer Science & IT Security, Master Artificial Intelligence, MBA MarketingBrowse their online degreesUniversity of Bath Online Courses available in: Business Analytics MSc, Applied Economics (Banking and Financial Markets) MSc, Artificial Intelligence Online MScBrowse their online degreesUniversity of Essex Online Courses available in: BSc (Hons) Business Psychology, MSc International Healthcare Management, Master of Education (M.Ed), Graduate Certificate in Infection Control Browse their online degreesWant more online degree suggestions?Use our free, online search engine to search 5,000+ online degree programs.

Discover Everything You Need To Know (Good And Bad) About Online Education One of the most oft-used terms after the pandemic is the term “new normal.” The new normal in education is the increased use of online learning tools. The COVID-19 pandemic has triggered new ways of learning. All around the world, educational institutions are looking toward online learning platforms to continue with the process of educating students. The new normal now is a transformed concept of education with online learning at the core of this transformation. Today, digital learning has emerged as a necessary resource for students and schools all over the world. For many educational institutes, this is an entirely new way of education that they have had to adopt. Online learning is now applicable not just to learn academics but it also extends to learning extracurricular activities for students as well. In recent months, the demand for online learning has risen significantly, and it will continue doing so in the future. As with most teaching methods, online learning also has its own set of positives and negatives. Decoding and understanding these positives and negatives will help institutes in creating strategies for more efficiently delivering the lessons, ensuring an uninterrupted learning journey for students. What Are The Advantages Of Online Learning? 1. Efficiency Online learning offers teachers an efficient way to deliver lessons to students. Online learning has a number of tools such as videos, PDFs, podcasts, and teachers can use all these tools as part of their lesson plans. By extending the lesson plan beyond traditional textbooks to include online resources, teachers are able to become more efficient educators. 2. Accessibility Of Time And Place Another advantage of online education is that it allows students to attend classes from any location of their choice. It also allows schools to reach out to a more extensive network of students, instead of being restricted by geographical boundaries. Additionally, online lectures can be recorded, archived, and shared for future reference. This allows students to access the learning material at a time of their comfort. Thus, online learning offers students the accessibility of time and place in education. 3. Affordability Another advantage of online learning is reduced financial costs. Online education is far more affordable as compared to physical learning. This is because online learning eliminates the cost points of student transportation, student meals, and most importantly, real estate. Additionally, all the course or study materials are available online, thus creating a paperless learning environment which is more affordable, while also being beneficial to the environment. 4. Improved Student Attendance Since online classes can be taken from home or location of choice, there are fewer chances of students missing out on lessons. 5. Suits A Variety Of Learning Styles Every student has a different learning journey and a different learning style. Some students are visual learners, while some students prefer to learn through audio. Similarly, some students thrive in the classroom, and other students are solo learners who get distracted by large groups. The online learning system, with its range of options and resources, can be personalized in many ways. It is the best way to create a perfect learning environment suited to the needs of each student. What Are The Disadvantages Of Online Learning? 1. Inability To Focus On Screens For many students, one of the biggest challenges of online learning is the struggle with focusing on the screen for long periods of time. With online learning, there is also a greater chance for students to be easily distracted by social media or other sites. Therefore, it is imperative for the teachers to keep their online classes crisp, engaging, and interactive to help students stay focused on the lesson. 2. Technology Issues Another key challenge of online classes is internet connectivity. While internet penetration has grown in leaps and bounds over the past few years, in smaller cities and towns, a consistent connection with decent speed is a problem. Without a consistent internet connection for students or teachers, there can be a lack of continuity in learning for the child. This is detrimental to the education process. 3. Sense Of Isolation Students can learn a lot from being in the company of their peers. However, in an online class, there are minimal physical interactions between students and teachers. This often results in a sense of isolation for the students. In this situation, it is imperative that the school allow for other forms of communication between the students, peers, and teachers. This can include online messages, emails and video conferencing that will allow for face-to-face interaction and reduce the sense of isolation. 4. Teacher Training Online learning requires teachers to have a basic understanding of using digital forms of learning. However, this is not the case always. Very often, teachers have a very basic understanding of technology. Sometimes, they don’t even have the necessary resources and tools to conducts online classes. To combat this, it is important for schools to invest in training teachers with the latest technology updates so that they can conduct their online classes seamlessly. 5. Manage Screen Time Many parents are concerned about the health hazards of having their children spend so many hours staring at a screen. This increase in screen time is one of the biggest concerns and disadvantages of online learning. Sometimes students also develop bad posture and other physical problems due to staying hunched in front of a screen. A good solution to this would be to give the students plenty of breaks from the screen to refresh their mind and their body. Fedena Fedena is all in one college and school management software.

By Benjamin Herold \\u2014 November 05, 2019 7 min read Share article Remove Save to favorites Save to favorites Print Email Facebook LinkedIn Twitter Copy URL Is it going to transform public schools, finally bringing education into the age of digitally driven personalization embodied by companies such as Amazon and Netflix? Or is it a billionaire-backed boondoggle, aimed primarily at replacing teachers and extracting data from children? When it comes to \\u201cpersonalized learning,\\u201d there\\u2019s no shortage of hyperbole from either proponents or critics.Here\\u2019s what you need to know about the realities of one of the biggest, most controversial trends in K-12 education\\u2014starting with the most difficult question first. What exactly is personalized learning? Inside K-12 schools, the term is used to mean just about anything. For many educators, it\\u2019s about using adaptive software that adjusts to each student\\u2019s skill level. Sometimes, it\\u2019s about the systematic use of digital data to inform big decisions, like how to group students. Other schools focus on giving students more say over what projects they undertake, or how they present their work. And increasingly, personalized-learning proponents also take a much wider lens, saying schools must nurture each individual child\\u2019s social, emotional, and physical development.Some see such scattered and nebulous definitions as reason to worry that personalized learning will go the way of other short-lived reforms. Others are more positive.\\u201cIn the same way that Inuits have lots of different words for \\u2018snow,\\u2019 I think these are all personalized learning,\\u201d says Larry Berger, the CEO of ed-tech company Amplify and a leading thinker and writer on the topic for over a decade. What\\u2019s the hope behind the movement? Very broadly speaking, the idea is to customize the learning experience for each student according to his or her unique skills, abilities, preferences, background, and experiences. The hope is that will improve a wide range of student outcomes, from engagement to achievement to wellbeing.Personalized-learning pioneer Dianne Tavenner told Education Week in 2017 that it\\u2019s about the type of education good teachers have always envisioned, but haven\\u2019t always had the tools to make a reality.\\u201cPersonalized learning is a way to actually enact the pedagogy we believe in and that kids thrive in,\\u201d said Tavenner, the founder of Summit Public Schools, a California-based charter network that operates about a dozen of its own personalized-learning schools while licensing its personalized-learning software to hundreds of others. So is this a new idea or not? Not really.The personalized learning movement has two primary wings, each of which is grounded in decades-old (and often warring) philosophies about how children learn. The so-called \\u201cengineering model\\u201d of personalized learning emphasizes efficient mastery of academic content. The idea is that experts can map out what each child needs to learn, measure what of that each already knows, and then create the optimal path for him or her to learn the rest.Other approaches to personalized learning are rooted in progressive education traditions. This wing of the movement generally holds that learning happens when schools tap into students\\u2019 interests and passions, giving them individualized opportunities to ask questions and explore and take risks. The former approach dates at least back to the 1950s, when psychologist B.F. Skinner was experimenting with \\u201cteaching machines\\u201d intended to let students answer questions and receive feedback at their own pace. The latter goes back more than a century, to John Dewey. It\\u2019s often seen today in schools that emphasize more project-based learning.In both cases, what is new is the way in which technology\\u2014from big data to online collaboration tools to social media\\u2014is being used to amplify methods educators have been using more or less forever. Where did the new push for personalized learning come from? Big-picture, it\\u2019s a reflection of deeper trends in both society and the K-12 sector.Technology has already transformed other sectors of society, such as retail. Often, this has taken the form of using digital data to learn more about individuals and their preferences, then target them with information, advertisements, and recommendations. In part, personalized learning is a reflection of the push to apply those tools and ideas to education.It\\u2019s also emerged out of rising opposition to standardized tests and the so-called \\u201cfactory model of education,\\u201d which critics contend has left both children and teachers feeling like widgets inside the classroom. These broad forces started to come together in tangible form roughly a decade ago.Beginning around 2009, for example, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation began committing hundreds of millions of dollars to support research and development around personalized learning. Then, under President Obama, the U.S. Education Department gave half a billion dollars to encourage districts to embrace the trend, primarily via its competitive-grant program known as Race to the Top. More recently, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, the venture-philanthropy group started by Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, pediatrician Priscilla Chan, has vowed to give hundreds of millions of dollars per year in support of its vision for \\u201cwhole-child personalized learning,\\u201d encompassing students\\u2019 emotional and physical development as well as their academic learning.States, companies, other philanthropies, and a network of nonprofits and advocacy groups are also now backing the movement. Do personalized learning strategies work? Oh yeah. Big-time.In 2018, for example, the Education Week Research Center conducted a nationally representative survey of the country\\u2019s school principals.More than half characterized personalized learning as either a \\u201ctransformational way to improve public education\\u201d or a \\u201cpromising idea.\\u201dA whopping 97 percent said their schools were using digital technologies to personalize learning in some form or fashion. Does personalized learning work? That\\u2019s precisely the wrong question to ask.John Pane, a senior scientist at the RAND Corporation and a leading researcher of the personalized learning movement says the reason why goes back to the incredible variation in how personalized learning actually happens inside real classrooms.\\u201cAt this stage, we really need to be looking at the actual components of what people are trying to do and assess them each on their own,\\u201d Pane said.That\\u2019s an argument that proponents generally embrace. They point to the strong research base for some of the core building blocks of most personalized-learning models, including providing students with differentiated instruction and real-time feedback.Some studies of specific personalized-learning products, used in particular situations and under particular circumstances, have also yielded promising signs.But other such studies have shown small or even negative results. And what about personalized-learning models that seek to transform entire schools? Experts estimate there are maybe 1,000 or so such schools in the country. How are they doing?Summit is one of the best-known, best-funded examples, having received more than $40 million from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative. But Tavenner\\u2019s group has declined to undergo independent third-party evaluation.The results for other models that have been studied are generally not great.\\u201cThe evidence base is very weak at this point,\\u201d said Pane, who led a Gates-funded study of about 40 personalized-learning schools, finding modest gains and big implementation challenges. Are there other arguments against personalized learning? You betcha. Critics such as independent researcher Audrey Watters warn that personalized learning is a pretext for \\u201cmassive data collection\\u201d and surveillance of students. They point to the rapid adoption of analogous technologies in other sectors (think, for example, Facebook), before the unintended and adverse privacy-related consequences we are now seeing could be ironed out. That 2018 Education Week Research Center survey also found that a strong majority of the nation\\u2019s principals worried that the trend was leading to too much screen time for students (85 percent expressed \\u201csome,\\u201d \\u201ca lot\\u201d or \\u201ca great deal\\u201d of concern), students working alone too often (77 percent), and the tech industry gaining too much influence over public education (67 percent.) Where does all that leave schools? Pane and his team at RAND say K-12 educators, administrators, and policymakers are in the unenviable position of having to make high-stakes educational decisions with \\u201cimperfect evidence.\\u201dThat doesn\\u2019t mean they should stick their heads in the sand, the RAND team said. Personalized learning holds promise. Careful, cautious attempts at some elements of the trend may make sense. Stick to common sense and the evidence we do have, they advise. Resist pressure to throw out established practices that work just because they\\u2019re not new and shiny. But think twice before diving in.\\u201cI would not advise schools to dump massive resources into going fully into personalized learning,\\u201d Laura S. Hamilton, a senior behavioral scientist and distinguished chair in learning and assessment at the RAND Corporation, told Education Week in 2017. \\u201cExperiment with some new approaches that might be a good fit for your particular school or district, but monitor it very closely.\\u201d Benjamin Herold Contributing Writer, Education Week Benjamin Herold was a contributing writer who covered learning environments and ed-tech issues for Education Week.

Let's be honest: as an academic term of art, personalized learning is horrible. It has almost no descriptive value. What does it mean to \\\"personalize\\\" learning? Isn't learning, which is done by individual learners, inherently personal? What would it mean to personalize learning? And who would want unpersonalized learning? Because the term carries so little semantic weight, it is a natural for marketing purposes: \\\"Our personalized learning is new, improved, and 99.44% pure!\\\" Unfortunately, this also sets it up perfectly for the inevitable War of Definitions. Remember the Great MOOC War a few years ago? Were MOOCs the creation of the Canadian Constructivists or of the Stanford professor who invented a self-driving car? Are we talking about an xMOOC or a cMOOC? Which one is the good one, and which one is the bad one? Now that the furor has died down, there is relatively little debating over the definition of the term MOOC and much more focus on how the family of approaches that are collected under that term can best serve different educational purposes. Let's just skip to the end this time, shall we? The two of us spent the past three years visiting colleges and universities that have undertaken so-called personalized learning projects, and we talked to the students, teachers, and administrators about what they are actually doing and why they are doing it. We visited a wide range of institutions and talked to a wide range of stakeholders, based on our daily work as consultants to colleges and universities and as analysts of the educational technology industry and our work on a grant funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Through these observations, we have been looking for the ground truth underneath the hype of personalized learning. As a result of this process, we observed a family of technology-enabled educational practices that are potentially useful for a range of educational challenges. We would like to share our framework, which we hope will be useful for thinking about (1) the circumstances under which personalized learning can help students and (2) the best way to evaluate the real educational value for products that are marketed under the personalized learning banner. e-Literate TV and the e-Literate Blog Many of our discussions with students, teachers, and administrators about personalized learning are documented in a series of rich-media case studies that we call e-Literate TV. The episodes include embedded links to more detailed content that is relevant to the conversations happening on-screen.

Personalized Learning as Practice Imagine for a moment that personalized learning is not already a term in the ed tech lexicon and, further, that there is no need for any new term to be \\\"catchy\\\" or \\\"sticky.\\\" The most descriptive label we could come up with for the practices that the two of us have observed in our school visits might be undepersonalized teaching. If the ideal, most personal teaching modality is one-to-one tutoring, there are many reasons why we fall short of this ideal in real-world classrooms. The most stereotypical depersonalized teaching experience is the large lecture class, but there are many other situations in which teachers do not connect with individual students and/or meet the students' specific needs. For example, even a small class might contain students with a wide-enough range of skills, aptitudes, and needs that the teacher cannot possibly serve them all equally well. Or a student may have needs (or aptitudes) that the teacher simply doesn't get an opportunity to see within the amount of contact time that the class allows. The truth is that students fall through the cracks all the time, even in the best classes taught by the best teachers. Failing a course is the most visible evidence, but more often students drift through the class and earn a passing grade\\u2014maybe even a good grade\\u2014without getting any lasting educational benefit. If we choose to think of personalized learning as a practice rather than a product, we can start by taking a hard look at course designs and identifying those areas that fail to make meaningful individual contact with students. These gaps will be different from course to course, subject to subject, student population to student population, and teacher to teacher. Although there is no generic answer to the question of where students are most likely to fall through the cracks in a course, there are some patterns to look for (as we will discuss later in this article). Technology then becomes an enabler for increasing meaningful personal contact. In our observations, we have seen three main technology-enabled strategies for lowering classroom barriers to one-on-one teacher/student (and student/student) interactions: Moving content broadcast out of the classroom: Even in relatively small classes, a lot of class time can be taken up with content broadcast such as lectures and announcements. Personalized learning strategies often try to move as much broadcast out of class time as possible in order to make room for more conversation. This strategy is sometimes called \\\"flipping\\\" because it is commonly accomplished by having the teacher record the lectures they would normally give in class and assign the lecture videos as homework, but it can be accomplished in other ways as well, for example with reading-based or problem-based course designs. Turning homework time into contact time: In a traditional class, much of the work that the students do is invisible to the teacher. For some aspects, such as homework problems, teachers can observe the results but are often severely limited by time constraints. In other cases, such as comprehension of assigned readings, the students' work is invisible to the teacher and can be observed only indirectly and with significant effort. Personalized learning approaches often allow the teacher to observe the students' work in digital products, so that there is more opportunity to coach students. Further, personalized learning often identifies meaningful trends in a student's work and calls the attention of both teacher and student to those trends through analytics. Providing tutoring: Sometimes students get stuck in problem areas that don't require help from a skilled human instructor. Although software isn't good at teaching everything, it can be good at teaching some things. Personalized learning approaches can offload the tutoring for those topics to adaptive learning software that gives students interactive feedback while also turning the students' work into contact time by making it observable to the teacher at a glance through analytics. None of these techniques, by themselves, undepersonalize the teaching. They generally need to be designed and implemented by skilled educators as part of a larger course design that is intended to address the particular problems of particular students. In the business world, an analogous initiative might be called \\\"business process redesign.\\\" Emphasis is on process. The primary question being asked is, \\\"What is the most effective way to accomplish the goal?\\\" The redesigned process may well need software, but it is the process itself that matters. In personalized learning, the process we are redesigning is that of teaching individual students what they need to learn from a class as effectively as possible (though we can easily imagine applying the same kind of exercise to improving advising, course registration, or any other important function). We saw a noteworthy example of this educational design work in action at Essex County College (ECC) in Newark, New Jersey. The majority of ECC students need to take developmental math in order to complete their degrees, and the majority of those do not pass developmental math. Of those who do, the majority do not pass the college-level math course that follows. ECC leadership believed that this educational failure could be attributed to two main factors. First, students came into developmental math with an enormous range of prior knowledge: some had the equivalent of a fourth-grade math education; others needed to learn only a few concepts. Students on one end of the spectrum typically got lost because they were not receiving the individual help they needed, whereas those on the other end often got bored and eventually failed or dropped out because they were being forced to spend a lot of their time on skills that they had already mastered. Second, many ECC students had never been taught good study skills, and faculty did not have the class time needed to teach those skills. So to address the two personalization gaps in this particular course, the college redesigned developmental math using personalized learning techniques. ECC used an overall pedagogical framework called Self-Regulated Learning. Students in the course spend part of their class time in a computer lab, working at their own pace through an adaptive learning math program. Students who already know much of the content can move through it quickly, giving them more time to master the concepts that they have yet to learn. Students who have more to learn can take their time and get tutoring and reinforcement from the software. Teachers, now freed from the task of lecturing, roam the room and give individual attention to those students who need it. They can also see how students are doing, individually and as a class, through the software's analytics. But the course has another critical component that takes place outside the computer lab, separate from the technology. Every week, the teachers meet with the students to discuss learning goals and strategies. Students review the goals they set the previous week, discuss their progress toward those goals, evaluate whether the strategies they used helped them, and develop new goals for the next week. Note the role of the software in this design. In the lab, it primarily takes on the role of tutor, helping most of the students most of the time with routine skill coaching and practice so that the teacher is freed up to give individual attention to those students who really need it. In the goal-setting sessions, the software acts mainly as a record keeper. It helps students track their time on task, number of problems solved, and so on. The teacher then helps students figure out what to do with that information. In both cases, the software is an important enabler of the new teaching practices. But the value that it adds is quite different from the way personalized learning software products are often characterized by sales reps, marketing materials, and many news stories. It is thus worth taking a minor detour from our exploration of personalized learning as a practice to examine the significant gap between the ground truth of the practice and the popular characterizations of the products. Why Such Hype? So far, we have deliberately and explicitly set aside the various policy, political, and business pressures that have brought the term personalized learning into broader use so that we could focus on the educational value that lurks underneath the hype. But it is also important to understand these pressures so that we can be on guard for the ways in which they might deform the discussion and distract us from the real value that we should be talking about. None of the three approaches that we identified above are particularly new; nor do they require fancy algorithms and expensive products to achieve. There are two specific reasons why these approaches are being attached to heavily marketed products right now. First, on the policy side, there has been a shift in emphasis from access to degree completion. President Barack Obama set the tone by announcing a goal that the United States be number one in the world in the proportion of college graduates by 2020. Since then, state and federal policy makers have followed suit. Colleges and universities now have to account for gainful employment metrics and track their institutional scorecard results. Base funding, particularly for public institutions, is increasingly tied to performance against these and similar metrics. Grant funding is also increasingly outcomes-driven. As higher education institutions have narrowed their focus on these metrics, the students who fall through the cracks and fail out of the standard educational model have come into sharper relief. With these policy changes and the funding that follows them, being \\\"student-centric\\\" is no longer a nice-to-have goal. Rather, it is a critical success factor for improving measurable student outcomes and therefore getting funding and being seen as a successful institution. For example, whereas in the past a few forward-thinking community college administrators might have thought to take on a project like ECC's personalized learning developmental math redesign out of a sense of mission, now every community college administrator must be looking for ways to improve degree completion by eliminating failure traps such as developmental math. The security of institutional funding depends on it. The second big change has been the widespread commercialization of the adaptive learning techniques that have existed in educational research laboratories for over fifty years.1 As the term adaptive learning suggests, these products provide students with a certain amount of one-on-one tutoring (although the methods that these systems use for analyzing students' progress and providing useful feedback vary widely by product and discipline). This change in the market has been enabled by technological advances that are increasingly resulting in one networked computer for every student in a class and affordable developer access to machine learning tools. Market forces are playing a big role in publishing too. Textbook publishers have found that their traditional business model is collapsing as more students find ways to avoid buying new textbooks. Cengage, for example, was forced to go through bankruptcy. McGraw-Hill Education was sold to a private equity firm. Pearson's stock is near historic lows. All of these companies have had multiple rounds of major layoffs. They are in desperate need of a new product, and they are increasingly latching onto the personalized learning trend as the cure for what ails them. Meanwhile, according to Ambient Insight, U.S. ed tech companies received $3.6 billion of angel and venture capital funding in 2015.2 (This doesn't even include mergers and acquisitions, which have also been huge.) Startup founders find themselves in an increasingly crowded field and are under strong pressure to promise and produce big results. Every vendor of a developmental math product, whether that vendor is an established textbook publisher or a young startup, is aware that campus presidents and provosts need to solve their degree-completion problem and that developmental math is very likely to be a big part of that problem. The vendors therefore market their products as a solution to degree completion. Every textbook vendor and aspiring textbook disruptor knows that stories about improving pass rates through technology sell. But what to call these products? Personalized learning is a term that sounds good without the inconvenience of having any obviously specific pedagogical meaning, so it becomes the flag that all vendors fly, even though different products do very different things and even though undepersonalization is rarely accomplished through software alone. Thus, through policy and commercialization, the personalized learning marketing juggernaut was born. Unfortunately, the combination of the marketing shortcuts and the funding pressures created a strong temptation for magical thinking. Campus leaders are being asked to believe that they can solve their degree-completion and other accountability metric problems by buying software that will somehow magically provide personalized learning (in a way that faculty members, by implication, do not). For obvious reasons, faculty are likely to reject this stunted conception of personalized learning. Leaders who want to see their campus communities benefit from personalized learning approaches need to guard against product-centric characterizations and should suggest that discussions of vended solutions take place in the context of course and curricular designs that undepersonalize teaching. Otherwise, the baby will probably get thrown out with the bathwater. Good Candidate Opportunities One of the benefits of reframing personalized learning as undepersonalized teaching and focusing on the three techniques we outlined earlier is that faculty can readily translate this framework into their own contexts and start identifying opportunities that are good candidates for undepersonalization (not all of which will require vended products). In contrast to a product-centric conception of personalized learning, a practice-centered conception is something that faculty can own. That said, we have seen areas of opportunity where personalized learning is often a good fit, and not all of those areas are always obvious. To begin with, any course that students enter with a wide range of prior knowledge and ability is a good candidate. ECC's developmental math is a prototypical example. Another example is Austin Community College's ACCelerator lab, used heavily for developmental math courses.3 But the course doesn't have to be remedial and the institution doesn't have to be access-oriented in order for personalized learning to be helpful. For example, at Middlebury College, a geography professor realized that some students in his course on geographical information systems (GIS) were struggling. For context, this is a general education course that is taken by students in a wide range of majors and specialties. In an elite college like Middlebury, nobody worries too much about completion rates, particularly at the institutional level. The professor simply observed that some students were working very hard. In fact, the course had such a strong reputation for difficulty that taking and passing it was considered a badge of honor. Students were sleeping in the labs. But the professor didn't see this as a sign that he was inspiring his students to work hard. He saw it, rather, as a course-design problem. Some students were working harder than they should because he wasn't reaching them in the way that they needed to be reached. As it turns out, one critical skill that the course was teaching\\u2014spatial reasoning\\u2014is rarely taught in high school. A handful of the students in the class came in with either prior training or natural talent. They did well. The others were the ones who were sleeping in the labs. They needed more time and more help. The professor decided to make videos of his lectures and assign the videos as homework. With this change, struggling students could watch the videos as often as they needed in the (relative) comfort of their own dorm rooms while the professor's class time was also freed up for more interactive work. (After he had done this, a colleague told the professor that this technique is called \\\"flipping the classroom\\\"\\u2014a term he had never heard before.) He is also thinking about developing tutorial software that can help students work through the homework problems in ways that best suit their needs. Another obvious opportunity to undepersonalize teaching is in large lecture courses. For example, administrators at the University of California, Davis, became interested in redesigning their survey biology and chemistry courses because they recognized that they were losing a high percentage of first-year students\\u2014the ones who typically take these large lecture courses. It is very easy for a student to become passive in this broadcast-heavy course design. The team involved in the course-redesign projects wanted students to both get more individual attention and take more individual responsibility for their learning. To accomplish these goals, the team employed personalized learning practices as a way of making room for more active learning in the classroom. Students used software-based homework to experience much of the content that had previously been delivered in lectures. Faculty redesigned their lecture periods to become interactive discussions. Meanwhile, the teaching assistants who ran the discussion sections used analytics from the homework software to identify the areas where students were struggling; as a result, they could better focus their class time on those areas. Importantly, teaching assistants received additional training in how to employ active learning principles in their teaching techniques. Once again, in contrast to marketing pitches and popular narratives, the software played only a supporting role, albeit an important one, in undepersonalizing the large lecture. A less obvious opportunity for personalized learning is in the design of problem-based learning courses. The previous two examples fit within the common understanding of personalized learning being used to help students work through traditional, didactic courses with more support. But Arizona State University incorporated the \\\"flipping\\\" aspect of the technology into an online STEM lab course for non\\u2013science majors. In this course students, for their final project, are asked to evaluate the likelihood that there are other intelligent civilizations in a randomly assigned field of stars. The teaching philosophy of the faculty member who was the lead designer of the course is that he should be a coach or a guide, helping students navigate difficult problems. In his view, both content delivery and assessment are activities that take time away from that core function. He and his colleagues framed the course, Habitable Worlds, as a series of challenges. Overcoming each challenge requires the students to learn new knowledge and skills. The course design is based on mastery learning: students must demonstrate that they have learned one skill before moving on to the next. The course is also difficult. Students often get stuck, which is by design. Faculty and teaching assistants, freed up from both content delivery and assignment grading, spend most of their time responding to students' questions. And because the coursework is all software-based, they can see exactly what students are doing, how far students have progressed, and where students are struggling. Students can proceed at their own pace, moving quickly where they can and getting help where they need it. Yet despite the self-paced nature of the course, there is also a strong social component. Students can and often do seek out each other's help. Because personalized learning practices make space for more interactivity, these practices often go hand-in-hand with active learning. And active learning is often social. We suspect there are many opportunities in addition to the ones we have identified here. If faculty are given a commonsense framework and a chance to experiment, refine, and share, they will find novel and exciting ways to better support their students' individual educational needs. Doing It Right Because personalized learning is a family of educational practices that support good course designs, implementing those practices well is not as simple as buying a product. To begin with, course design is always a time-consuming process when done correctly. Second, in many cases faculty will be trying techniques they have not used before, requiring them to teach in ways that are very different from how they have taught before, that are far removed from their experience (and therefore instincts) of what works and what doesn't, and that may have ripple effects they don't anticipate. On top of all this, the vast majority of faculty are neither trained in course design/research nor compensated for any time they invest in it. They will need time and support. In many cases, implementing personalized learning well can require an institutional effort analogous to the one required to implement an online learning program well. Looking across a range of personalized learning projects that have had varying degrees of success, both at the schools we visited and elsewhere, we can identify six steps for a successful strategy. It should be noted that these themes could be applied to any number of pedagogical innovations. Identify the student need that is to be addressed. The various personalized learning approaches are just one set of tools in the toolbox. Successful programs generally start by identifying a significant educational problem that faculty and program staff believe can be corrected with a change in course design. Design the pedagogical structure. If the problem that is identified can be addressed through personalization, then how will the course support different students differently? The answer has to be more than just \\\"adaptive learning.\\\" Successful programs identify opportunities in the course design to improve individual support for students. Pick the products or technologies. The details of different products or technological approaches are most meaningful when they impact what can be done with the course design. Successful programs pick the right tool based on the job at hand rather than on who has the best marketing pitch. Don't forget faculty training. Because personalized learning, done properly, generally means implementing new pedagogical approaches, faculty may need to learn to teach in ways that they haven't taught before. Successful programs provide faculty with training and pedagogical support. Don't forget technology support. Software helps with learning only when it works, and Murphy's Law can hit with a vengeance when technology is mixed with teaching. Successful programs make sure that faculty have the technology training, equipment, and support staff that they need in order to be successful. Be prepared to measure, fail, and iterate. Because personalized learning approaches often require new software, new teaching techniques for faculty, new responsibilities for students, and in some cases new scheduling challenges, institutions will almost inevitably get some things wrong in the first couple of iterations, and those mistakes may have real impact on outcomes. Successful programs approach implementation empirically but with patience. On the bright side, the fact that personalized learning is now being attached to funding-related metrics such as degree-completion rates means that attaching institutional support costs to a funding stream will also be easier. In many cases, schools can build personalized learning \\\"muscle mass\\\" by focusing on metric-relevant projects first and then expanding the initiative once the critical institutional knowledge and support mechanisms have been put in place. Final Thoughts: Ed Tech Groundhog Day There is a lesson to be learned here, and it is broader than personalized learning. Every popular ed tech trend, going at least as far back as the original online asynchronous distance learning courses in the 1990s, has brought with it a food fight, with proponents hyping the trend as revolutionary and opponents attacking it as harmful. And in every case, a policy or other institutional driver has resulted in a rush of companies responding to the market opportunity created by that driver. Together, these forces generate hype and magical thinking, which in turn provoke an equal and opposite reaction. In this article, we have tried to identify specific teaching practices being used by educators, and we have tried to describe them in commonsense terms that should make intuitive sense to experienced teachers. These practices always exist at the beginning. Some teacher somewhere comes up with a specific approach to a specific problem. External forces then make that problem a more institutionally consequential one, and companies rush in to name, market, and sell solutions. In the process, we lose track of the original educational idea. It's like playing a game of telephone in a noisy airport. Except in this case, the message in the game is an actual plan for how we are going to help our students, and when it gets to the end of the telephone line, we will act as if we received the message with perfect fidelity. And then fight over it. Endlessly. Much of the Gartner hype cycle can be attributed to this process.4 We can break out of this hype cycle with a fairly simple (though not necessarily easy) approach. Whenever a new ed tech trend gets named\\u2014whether it is distance learning, adaptive learning, personalized learning, competency-based education, MOOCs, or something else\\u2014we should start trying to understand that trend by looking for the best examples of what teachers and students are doing when they are doing the thing we just named. We should ask them what they are doing, and why. We should ask how their practice is working and what they are learning and what they don't yet know. We should attach the name of the new trend to those educational practices and those reasons\\u2014rather than to any products, technologies, or services. We should not waste time debating whether the name we came up with for those practices is the perfect name or exactly what it includes or excludes. Instead, we should spend our time trying to understand the practices themselves and their applicability to the educational problems we are trying to solve. Yes, personalized learning is a lousy term, but it is attached to legitimate educational practices that have the potential to improve the lives of many students. It is also a term that is trapped in the early stages of its hype cycle. So let's just skip to the end and break personalized learning out of the hype cycle by doing our best to understand\\u2014and explain\\u2014what it really is and why it really matters.

Overview[edit] The use of the term \\\"personalized learning\\\" dates back to at least the early 1960s,[1] but there is no widespread agreement on the definition and components of a personal learning environment.[2] Even enthusiasts for the concept admit that personal learning is an evolving term and doesn't have any widely accepted definition.[3] In 2005, Dan Buckley defined two ends of the personalized learning spectrum: \\\"personalization for the learner\\\", in which the teacher tailors the learning, and \\\"personalization by the learner\\\", in which the learner develops skills to tailor his own learning. This spectrum was adopted by the (2006) Microsoft's Practical Guide to Envisioning and Transforming Education.[4] Definitions[edit] The United States National Education Technology Plan 2017 defines personalized learning as follows: Personalized learning refers to instruction in which the pace of learning and the instructional approach are optimized for the needs of each learner. Learning objectives, instructional approaches, and instructional content (and its sequencing) may all vary based on learner needs. In addition, learning activities are meaningful and relevant to learners, driven by their interests, and often self-initiated.[5] Typically technology is used to try to facilitate personalized learning environments.[6] According to researcher Eduard Pogorskiy: ICT can be a powerful tool for personalized learning as it allows learners access to research and information, and provides a mechanism for communication, debate, and recording learning achievements. However, personalized learning is not exclusive to digital technologies or environments. In the rhetoric around 21st Century Skills, personalized learning is often equated with 'customization' (as found in the business world), with digital personalization used to frame the learning experience as highly efficient. Problematic in this is the discounting of the highly relational and socially constructed space well defined in the research on learning. Narrowing personalized learning to its digital form also raises the concern of the echo chamber effect emerging in (hyper)personalized online experiences.[7] Instructional design[edit] Proponents of personalized learning say that many elements of curriculum, assessment, and instructional design must be present in classrooms for students to succeed and often use software systems to manage and facilitate student-led instruction. Proponents argue that classroom learning activities must build upon students' prior knowledge and teachers need to allocate time for practice. Advocates argue that teachers must continuously assess student learning against clearly defined standards and goals, and student input into the assessment process is integral.[8][9][10] Conferring[edit] As stated above by the 2017 United States National Education Technology Plan, \\\"Personalized learning refers to instruction in which the pace of learning and the instructional approach are optimized the needs for each learner.\\\" Conferring is a process in which this can be accomplished. Conferring, as defined by Julie Kallio, is a \\\"regular, goal-oriented meeting between the teacher and student(s) where they talk about learning progress, process, and/or products.\\\" Conferring, more simply, is a way to provide more personalized feedback. Learning, in any context, requires some form of feedback. In schools, this feedback is almost entirely thought of as the teacher providing feedback to the student. The idea of providing feedback to advance student learning is best understood in the framework of the \\\"zone of proximal development\\\" or ZPD.[11] Psychologist Lev Vygotski has defined the ZPD as \\\"the distance between the actual developmental level as determined by independent problem solving and the level of potential development as determined through problem solving under adult guidance or in collaboration with more capable peers\\\".[11] More plainly, a student has a certain level they can achieve by themselves and with support they are able to achieve a higher level of learning. However, there is still some level in which the student is incapable of reaching, no matter what support is provided. For example, a student may be working on double digit addition. Their current knowledge may already provide them with the skills to move on to triple digit addition without any help. If the student is introduced to multiplication, however, they will need help to understand that multiplication is a quicker way to represent the same number being added onto itself a defined number of times. Where this help occurs is the student's ZPD. Even with help though, it is not reasonable to expect the student to learn how to solve a calculus problem. The struggle for teachers is how to provide the right amount of help to each student. If a teacher provides information to the whole class too quickly, some students are left behind trying to figure out the first step. Conversely, if a teacher provides information to the whole class too slowly, some students will finish rapidly and be left with nothing to do. Conferring is a tool that teachers have used to help mitigate that issue. Conferring first gained prominence in the book One to one: the art of conferring with young writers by Lucy Calkins, Amanda Hartman, and Zoe Ryder White.[12] In the work, Calkins and her co-writers describe how effective writing workshops for students included individual writing conferences (conferring), where teachers would sit and talk with their students about their writing. Per the book, \\\"Conferring can give us the force that makes our mini-lessons and curriculum development and assessment and everything else more powerful. It gives us an endless resource of teaching wisdom, an endless source of accountability, a system of checks and balances. And, it gives us laughter and human connection -the understanding of our children that gives spirit to our teaching.\\\"[12] Calkins believed that there were three main components to every conferring session: Research, Decide, and Teach. Research focused on where the student was in their current writing, Decide would help the teacher choose what to teach the student, and Teach would use modeling and guiding practice to further advance student learning. In their book The Writing Workshop, Katie Wood Ray and Lester L. Laminack added a fourth component in where after the teaching portion, the student and/or the teacher would \\\"Make a Record\\\".[13] This modified model can be thought in the terms of: research, decide, teach, record. The benefits of using conferring have been documented in a couple of studies. Using a mix method case study approach in observing a group of 4th grade students, Javaye Devette Stubbs posed the question: \\\"How does the implementation of one-on-one conferring promote higher order thinking skills in students with difficulties in reading?\\\"[14] The results from her pre and post-test found that \\\"even those with reading difficulties did show a significant gain in higher order thinking skills\\\".[14] In a separate study, the educator Antony Smith examined the effectiveness of using teacher-student writing conference for English language learners (ELLs).[15] Observing two students who were ELLs in a second-grade classroom working on a book project, Smith found that the work produced \\\"looks similar to what is produced by native English speakers\\\".[15] Smith later suggests that the success of the two students were largely tied to the writing conferences, and goes on to state that writing conferences are the \\\"heart of the writing process, and with this in mind, the potential of the teacher-student writing conference becomes clear\\\".[15] The information can be summarized into three main takeaways. First, building student knowledge is dependent on the current level of knowledge the student has and what kind of support they are provided. Second, conferring is a model that can provide student support through a structured four-part process. Third, conferring has been shown to increase student learning in both reading and writing. Debate[edit] Andy Hargreaves and Dennis Shirley write that while there are advantages in students being able to access information instantly on-line, one should not mistake such processes for \\\"something deeper, more challenging, and more connected to compelling issues in their world and their lives\\\".[16] Alfie Kohn wrote that while personalized learning may sound like a useful strategy for education, in practice it is mostly just about selling technology products. Personalized learning promises a strategy to specifically adjust education to the unique needs and skills of individual children, he argued, but really it means merely \\\"adjusting the difficulty level of prefabricated skills-based exercises based on students' test scores... [and] requires the purchase of software from one of those companies that can afford full-page ads in Education Week\\\". While \\\"certain forms of technology can be used to support progressive education\\\", Kohn wrote, \\\"...meaningful (and truly personal) learning never requires technology. Therefore, if an idea like personalization is presented from the start as entailing software or a screen, we ought to be extremely skeptical about who really benefits.\\\"[17] Next steps for research[edit] Dr. Ces'Ari Garcia-Delmuro advocated in her research on personalized learning for other researchers to continue including teacher voice in their studies of personalized learning programs as a way to improve these programs for teachers and students.[18] She said more studies should be conducted that focus on other low SES schools implementing personalized learning. Furthermore, donors that are giving to the advancement of personalized learning need to consult new research to ensure that they are donating to programs that benefit all students including those who belong to vulnerable populations (students in special education, bilingual emergent students, and students of low socioeconomic status), not just those students who are able to self-direct. In future research, it is important to continue to study these schools who are piloting personalized learning to see how their needs change over time. Because these programs are still relatively new, it would be helpful to understand the perceptions of teachers who are using these programs for five years or longer to continue assisting teacher and school sites as they mature in their personalized learning use. Additionally, research which compares teacher perception of personalized learning compared to student academic outcomes will be helpful once schools new to personalized learning overcome their fifth year of implementation.
